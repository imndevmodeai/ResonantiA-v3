I can see from the terminal output that you have a WebSocket server running and want to query about Alexandra Marie Dean. Let me first examine the current project structure to understand how to properly run the query.


Now let me examine the WebSocket server to understand how it works:


Now let me check if there's a client or frontend to interact with the WebSocket server:


Perfect! Now I understand the system. You have a Next.js application with a WebSocket server that connects to an ArchE CLI system. The WebSocket server is running on port 3002, and there's a frontend chat interface that can send queries. Let me start the development server and then send your query about Alexandra Marie Dean.


Now let me start the WebSocket server in a separate terminal:


Let me check if the servers are running properly:


Great! Both servers are running. Now let me create a simple test script to send your query directly to the WebSocket server:


```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');

// Create WebSocket connection
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3002');

ws.on('open', function open() {
  console.log('Connected to WebSocket server');
  
  // Send the query about Alexandra Marie Dean
  const query = {
    type: 'query',
    data: 'who is Alexandra Marie Dean from Florida born 09/08/1992',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  console.log('Sending query:', query.data);
  ws.send(JSON.stringify(query));
});

ws.on('message', function message(data) {
  try {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(data);
    console.log('Received:', parsed.type, parsed.data || parsed.message || JSON.stringify(parsed));
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Received raw data:', data.toString());
  }
});

ws.on('close', function close() {
  console.log('Connection closed');
});

ws.on('error', function error(err) {
  console.error('WebSocket error:', err);
});

// Close connection after 30 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Closing connection...');
  ws.close();
  process.exit(0);
}, 30000);
```

Now let me run the test script to send your query:


I can see the system is working! The ArchE CLI is processing your query about Alexandra Marie Dean. Let me check if there are any output files or results generated:


Let me check the most recent run events to see the results:


I can see the system executed a search but there was an issue with the API key for text generation. Let me check if there are any search results files:


Great! Let me read the search results:


Perfect! The search was successful and found information about Alexandra Marie Dean. Let me create a summary of the results for you:
