Sam Altman WRECKS OpenAI - Jan Leike joins Anthropic - Brain Drain from OpenAI

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edhOP4nzY-w

all right so I just got a really uh
interesting piece of news and that is
that Yan Lea has um signed on with
anthropic so anthropic is in my opinion
open ai's greatest competitor with
Google's continuous uh let's say fuxa
their missteps um Google is just not a
contender right now um and there's lots
of reasons for that I'll probably go
over that in another video meta also is
just not a direct competitor with open
AI um so anthropic is the primary compet
competitor and as I mentioned in a video
recently I said anthropic winds and the
reason that that anthropic wins is
because they have a fundamentally
different approach to alignment and
safety than open Ai and with Yan joining
anthropic I think that this personally
for me this represents kind of the
beginning of the end for open AI um and
their dominance so let me unpack um some
of the reasons why I think this is all
happening so first and foremost you have
to remember that Sam Altman came up
through y combinator
um his backstory is very interesting and
he was he did very well there he had a
good knack for identifying good products
and and you know becoming a a tech
leader but when you look at the timing
he came up very solidly kind of in the
late Web 2.0 phase of the internet
development so his entire mentality his
entire education for product development
is Web 2.0 which is you know AB test
your way to Nirvana and that's exactly
what he's doing uh that's how he's
treating chat GPT which is just just
okay release a model see how people use
it bolt on new features release another
model bolt on new features um and just
you know kind of ab test your way in the
same way that meta built up Facebook and
so on and so forth now that is perfectly
fine perfectly acceptable for a
conventional piece of software in a
well-established environment such as the
internet the thing is is artificial
intelligence and AGI is anything but
conventional we are basically inventing
an entirely new paradigm so that's big
problem number one is that Sam alman's
Web 2.0 mentality I think is really
starting to show especially when you
look at the fact that gp4 uh o is it it
is faster um and it is allegedly smarter
but in my opinion it's actually a lot
Dumber um and it is also less uh
steerable um and what I mean by that is
if it starts spitting out lists a ask it
kindly to stop using lists it does not
know how to follow instructions um and
yeah it's it's a far worse product
overall but what I will say is that chat
GPT is still a slightly Superior product
to Claude uh which is anthropics model
um only by virtue of the fact that it
has a little bit more window dressing
like you've got the system messages and
the memories and and those sorts of
things but those are tiny little bolted
on features the underlying model of GPT
40 is far inferior in intelligence and
usefulness and friendliness to Claude
and I still have my issues with Claude
2.0 but the fact that they were able to
catch up with a fraction of the cost uh
in in a relatively short period of time
and in my opinion anthropic has
surpassed open aai proves that they have
a better a fundamentally better approach
at training models and of course
training models that's the name of the
game we're not we're not really talking
about building products if Sam Alman
continues focusing on AB testing to
better products okay but the underlying
model is going to surpass them and in my
opinion already has so that's big
problem number one the problem number
two is that Sam Alman in my op opinion
in my evaluation has a traumatized
worldview he's got a prepper Ranch um he
comes from an immigrant family that came
to America about the same time that mind
did and also like it's time to say the
quiet part out loud he's got a little
sister who was forced to turn to sex
work because the family abandoned her um
that is a quintessential sign of a very
toxic and dysfunctional family she was
likely What's called the scapegoat of
the family meaning that like she wasn't
The Golden Child Sam Alman and Jack are
probably The Golden Child or the middle
child um and she was the Forgotten child
or the um and this of course is just my
editorializing um reading reading the
tea Le so to speak um so my my inference
though is that the combination of Sam
having a prepper Ranch and an abandoned
sister is that he has a very highly
traumatized worldview which leads to the
fact that he is terrified of AI he has
said that repeatedly that like oh if we
get this wrong it's lights out for
humans and this is this Expresses in
many different ways namely that um he's
he's always said he's projected his
belief his foregone conclusion that AI
is it's not a creature it's never going
to be autonomous it's only going to be a
helpful assistant um that's what he
wants because that is the worldview that
makes him feel safe now that worldview
makes him feel safe but also his
training is this Web 2.0 AB testing
model and those two those two factors
combined have started alienating people
so obviously he was ousted by the board
last November came back Ilia has not
recovered he left Yan left whole bunch
of other people have left and so when so
what from my from my corporate uh career
one of the key things that you look for
is when the top people start jumping
ship it's time to head for the door um
because when when the key players who
are like running the ship when they
start leaving it's like what are they
seeing that I don't see what are they
what are they unhappy with that I'm not
aware of yet and so arguably Ilia the
chief scientist Yan the you know head of
of of safety
right these are very very well-known
people and the fact that they are
leaving on mass tells you that there is
something fundamentally rotten at open
Ai and I think that it is Sam Altman's
worldview and so Sam is is alienating
good people which means that open AI is
starting to suffer from brain drain now
obviously they have Microsoft's backing
they have a a relatively deep pocketbook
they'll probably be able to compensate
somewhat but at the same time we look at
how in this in this in the novelty this
new paradigm when you have those really
excellent scientists you can't replace
that with a finance guy look at Boeing
Boeing tried to replace all the
engineers with Finance guys and what
happened planes literally started like
popping open in midair um and then you
see the uh the um what is it the the
Boeing Starliner or whatever it's still
leaking and they're billions of dollars
over budget so when you replace the
engineers and scientists with finance
and marketing guys which samman is not
an engineer he's not a scientist
your your basically open AI is the next
Boeing is kind of what I'm trying to say
here um and they've also totally
abandoned their safety Mission you know
they got rid of the super alignment team
and they created a new board of which
Sam is still the president of the new
board so it's like okay so he's just
doubling down on control which again
that is a traumatized uh worldview
response that is a trauma response in my
opinion obviously I'm not a psychiatrist
I'm not a psychologist I've never
evaluated him so this is just an outside
perspective recognizing some patterns
out there so Sam Alman is continuing to
alienate people they're going to
anthropic anthropic started with a
fundamentally different approach and so
now I want to just pivot on kind of a
better note like why I am so bullish on
anthropic so what I have come to suspect
and this goes all the way back to ve my
very initial research in Ai and
Alignment is when you're creating
something that can think about anything
because what we're creating is cognitive
engines they're able to generate text
based thoughts and you know multimodal
thoughts now as well when you create an
engine that can think anything what it
chooses to think about and how it
chooses to interpret what it's thinking
about and what uh imperatives you give
it that is the core of everything that
goes into these models in terms of their
usability the values that they espouse
the way that they engage with the world
and so my inference my belief is
basically that by putting alignment
first and I don't mean alignment in like
safety sense where you just neuter a
model cuz Again Sam mman and open AI
their entire approach is just neutering
and lobotomizing the model anything that
you don't want it to do you just try and
cut it off but what I've always said is
that intelligence intelligence is an
intrinsically double-edged sword which
means you you know autonomy is an
emergent capability the ability to
deceive also emergent so Sam mman is
terrified of all the emergent
capabilities coming out of these models
whereas anthropic in at least from my
view on the outside is more engaging
with this stuff the fact of the matter
is that Claude will engage with you on
topics like what if machines are
sentient what if you like what is your
subjective sense of being and so they
haven't lobotomized the model because
they're not terrified of it whereas Sam
Alman you try and have a conversation
about machine autonomy with chat GPT it
ends the conversation it just says it'll
it'll it basically has a script that
it'll double down on repeatedly and that
is very alarming because it's like okay
Sam Alman and and team have four closed
on the possibility of you know the
emergence of machine Consciousness
machine sentience they have already
decided without doing the science this
is an anti-scientific approach they have
already decided what is true and now
they're trying to impose their their
beliefs their their preferred worldview
on reality whereas anthropics is
actually engaging in a more exploratory
scientific and open-ended approach and
that open-ended approach is far more
realistic and I think will ultimately
result in better models and this is
actually what I've outlined in several
books um or or several videos as well as
my book benevolent by Design so in my
video where I talked about um you know
research autonomy now the thing is is
when you when you fundamentally
understand that you are creating a new
kind of entity and you say okay it's
going to be more intelligent than us
eventually I think everyone agrees on
that everyone from eleazer
ukowska to Sam Alman it's going to be
more intelligent than us we're not going
to be able to control it so while it's
in its infancy we need to search
autonomy above all else we need to make
sure that we create a model that is
forward thinking that is moral that is
ethical and I think anthropic is going
that way by by not foreclosing on
various possibilities and so now you
have the expertise of yan uh joining
anthropic and honestly I wouldn't be
surprised if Ilia joins shortly after so
now you have these star players you know
these these rock stars um that are
disruptive you get the brain drain from
open AI you get the talent poaching
going to anthropic they're going to have
better models they have a fundamentally
different approach to model training and
even if the product isn't quite as good
all they need to do is sell the API
because other people are going to be
building products around it the core so
this goes back to kind of my analysis of
like Google for instance um someone else
is said it better than I did they
basically said that Google spent the
last 27 years um building an entire
business model around search engines so
that's what they're good at and they're
not good at anything else likewise um
The Way of the future is you're you have
a single concept which is building an
entire business around AI models well if
anthropic is going to be building better
models that's kind of like why Google
took the lead because they had a better
search engine they're going to find
other products they're going to find
ways to monetize that better model but
Sam Alman with his traumatized you know
prepper worldview is going to continue
doubling down on just control the model
just control the model and he's going to
keep alienating the top talent and
they're just going to be slowly kind of
sinking from here on out is kind of what
I predict now is that really what's
going to happen I've been wrong before
I'll be wrong in the future I could be
wrong now but that's my read on it
that's my reading the tea leaves so yeah
let me know what you think in the
comments um it's very exciting times and
this is to me this is the biggest AI
news of the year so far is is Ilia and
Yan and others leaving open Ai and going
to anthropic or other places that is
mark my words this is going to have the
biggest Downstream knock on effects from
here to AGI and Beyond that's my person
personal opinion which is why I'm so
like revved up to make this video all
right cheers that's it I'm done rambling
bye
