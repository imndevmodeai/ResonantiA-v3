Build Anything with Perplexity, Here’s How

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_YRnA8RdnU

my name is David Andre and I'm going to show you how to build anything with perplexity if you're new here perplexity
is an AI tool that specializes in web search for example you can say tell me
about the Elon Musk and Yan Leon Twitter brief and it will give you the answer because it takes an llm a large language
model and gives it the power to search the web so in this video I'm going to show you how to use this powerful AI
tool to make literally anything even if you aren't a programmer now you might be thinking but David CAD GPT can also
search the web and you're right however perplexity is a completely different level check this out in ch GPT if we
look at this it's not even five sites it's actually three while perplexity went through 20 different websites and
we can see all of them are different sources but what's even better is that as you can see I'm using clo fre Opus
meaning in complexity you can choose which llm you want to use and this is also why a lot of programmers prefer to
use perplexity because you can use clo fre Opus to generate the code and then switch to GPT 4 to debug the code for
one subscription you get all of this which is why if I only could pay for one tool it would be perplexity now to be
honest even the free version is really solid however in this video I'm going to be using the paid version so if you want
50% off I'm going to include a link in the description now I don't even know what I'm going to build yet I'm going to
let perplexity choose that list out 10 types of cool projects that I could
build assume I am not a programmer and what's great is that here in the focus
button you can actually change what perplexity should focus on by default
it's on all which means search across the entire internet you know exploring all the sources as we saw before but you
can also do academic search in published academic papers or writing which is one
of my favorites generate the text without searching the web so for this I would probably go with writing because I
just want the ideas I just want the llm to generate ideas not necessarily look online for them right distraction
blocker oh my God we could actually build a simple productivity extension perhaps okay I have an idea actually
something that lets you choose between going to your task list and going to the website you want to visit so
perhaps each time I visit I want to visit wit.com or x.com you know both
domains I have to be checked in it would give me two buttons one
redirecting me to my task list and the other allowing me to continue to the
side give me five potential ideas how we could we could
execute actually I should probably shouldn't use idea how we could execute upon this idea five
potential let's say designs okay now we're getting more spefic
specific and we are going to get into building I have a empty python project which actually I don't even know why I
have a python project um I guess I didn't know we're going to build a extension obviously for a Chrome
extension we need HTML CSS and JavaScript but even if you didn't know that I mean we'll see perplexity will
help us figure that out so uh it's building up upon the chat right that's the beauty of perplexity and especially
CLA 3 Opus because it's it's using the llm obviously the LM is the brain it's
the main thing and perplexity just builds very nice search tools and you know behind the scenes prompts on top of
it CLA free Opus has 200k context window meaning your chat can be very long
before it runs out of context and it also includes all of the Snippets from
the websites in the you know all the retrieval in the context window so you
know it can fill up but with 200k cl if you're using CLA 3E you have 200k you're
chilling you don't have to worry about that so here are five potential designs for a simple productivity Chrome extension okay popup
prompt when the user tries to visit a distracting site like Twitter a popup appears the popup has two buttons go to
task list and continue to site hm almost as if it's just my idea okay let's see
what it added though yeah task list URL yes okay okay
to wup could have a simple clean design with a reminder message about staying focused uh I don't like these messages
to be honest I just want the button like you know okay it could say like are you
choosing to waste time or back to work or something like that okay sidebar Notch when the distracting side loads a
sidebar slides in from the right of the browser what
okay this is just bad full page intertial what what is that word inter
okay I don't even know extension redirects you you want to
stay
focused okay this I don't know what what exactly is different here Omni books action whatever I'm not even going to
read this I'm I just want the first execution this design is by far the best
okay assume I am a complete beginner when it comes to
HTML CSS and JavaScript tell me what to
do next step by step I do have vs code
installed and open by the way if you don't have vs code installed and open
just use perplexity I mean it's amazing how many people even people who are in the AI space are still um not using
perplexity okay wait this is what I wanted to sear show you if you're using the pro search in perplexity which you
know is 20 bucks a month or 10 if you use my link below you sometimes get this
followup question which personally um sometimes I would like to skip it because I just want to go fast but a lot
of people love this feature because it you can give it more context that you wouldn't think of while writing the
original prompt so let's see what's the URL of your task list uh I'm just going to do skip for now we'll figure that out
later I'm going to use todoist but it doesn't matter the design of the Chrome extension is exactly the same no matter
where you want to redirect so okay let's
see again goes through 20 different sources and starts giving you Steps step
by step now yeah as I was saying if you get stuck at any point just please use
this tool so many people just ask you know even email me questions that could
be answered by perplexity I'm like baffled every single day I get at least one or two emails that are just simple
questions that could even chat GPD or Pro answer so please don't be one of
those people that just consumes videos actually start using this tool in your day-to-day replace your Google if you
have your default window uh set to Google or what whatever replace it with perplexity or CH GPD that way you start
building the habits to become an AI focused person which you know actually using the AI tools is how you get the
benefits not watching videos about it so let's see what CLA free is cooking up great choice blah blah blah step one
create the project directory in vs code click on file in the top menu and select open folder so let's do that
actually okay so I'm going to do it like this oh um open folder we have that
yes okay we we have a folder I just named it code but whatever new file I'm
going to name it manifest.json okay new file manifest.json again you don't have to know any
JavaScript here I'm a complete dummy when it comes to JavaScript I mean I made one video on it but that's about it
so been a few months I probably forgot about a lot but that's the thing
JavaScript and actually Json is you know um JavaScript object notation if I'm not
mistaken you don't have to know this you can use the AI tools to do that for you
you just need to have an idea and make a decision to build that idea that is all you need in this age so don't be
overwhelmed like oh my God I don't understand every line of code you can build simple Chrome extensions without
understanding the code it just just watch what I do okay so we have the file
manifest ad Json and open it copy and paste the following code going to click the copy button plain and simple and
going to paste it control s to save so just a quick glance we can see that we
have multiple different categories in the Json file different lists
permissions host permissions actions default popup some icons or we probably
need to add those I guess um whatever let's see this manifest file tells
Chrome about your extension its name version icons blah blah blah step three create the popup HTML file okay I don't
know why they named it popup but I guess that's going to be the name of our productivity Chrome extension just uh
popup new file HTML and this is going to be the main HTML and I'm going to Simply
copy paste this code that perlex gave me okay so this is the text do you want
to continue to this potentially distracting site or go to your task list instead this is this is so weak we need
to have do you really want to waste your life away okay I'm just going to do
David Andre's productivity super extension uh let's go
back this creates the basic structure of your popups so we need the JavaScript right now so I'm just going to name this
it's very important to have the exact same name that way there is no conflict when the files want to communicate with
each other that's why I'm copy pasting it from perplexity instead of manually typing and let's copy the JavaScript
okay I guess this is missing so we need to expand on this Javascript file maybe
CL 3 was feeling a bit lazy we'll see this JavaScript waits for the popup well
actually no it needs to just click and then do nothing right okay maybe we have
to change this to be replace the current URL instead of opening a new window we'll see we'll see
the JavaScript waits for the popup HTML to load then finds the two buttons and
adds click events listeners to them Tas clicks button opens a new tab to
ur okay we need to change that yeah we need to change that our script okay our
script needs to change the current website replace the to-do line what
allow continue to the original side to let the user continue to the original distracting side when they click
continue replace SL SL Todo line okay I don't know why I didn't
write that right away but
sure this code grabs the current Ur and reloads it then closes the pop okay
style okay now we need to see CSS to you know add some style so it's not
completely Bare Bones and I did exactly what I advised against doing which is typing the name but since it's so simple
you know it's hard to mess up anyways we're going to copy this obviously
CSS no point going over this customizing it um you can customize it endlessly you
can spend endless hours adjusting colors and borders but we're interested in building a productivity Chrome extension
that works only using perplexity if you noticed I haven't written a single line
of code I'm just getting perplexity to search the web and use CLA free as the
llm to give me the code I mean legit I'm not lying when I
say like I'm terrible at JavaScript I know this like just the fundamentals of HTML and CSS
so if you're not into programming if you haven't bu built any websites in your life if you haven't built any Chrome
extensions you can still do this just ask it to go slower or explain it if you want So Okay add icons download icon
images for your extensions okay you know what actually why not
create these why not create these we can create these within perplexity if you most people don't know this but
perplexity can create images so right here we have the generate image feature and we can do that so choose the style
we can actually do custom prompt and um
Let's do an icon a minimalist icon for a
productivity Chrome extension uh
simple simple simple minimalist icon whatever
submit let's see what it Cooks up if it's pretty bad I can always change to uh D free in the settings I mean this is
okay I guess nothing crazy but the point here is just have an icon so going to
open Photoshop and just make the three different sizes 16 by 16 okay let's
start by 128 by 128 so I'm going to do8
by 128 boom create and this is our
icon let's take this image and let's you know I'm going to just screenshot it
paste and obviously it's much bigger than that so we have to center it boom
boom and realign it obviously this icon I mean I would spend a lot more time on
the logo but like this is not about the logo so yeah this will work icon 128.
PNG okay all right so let's go back into Photoshop
and save this as one icon one 28 and El has to be BNG and the next one
was 48 and 16 okay so let's do the same simply you know changing the name icon
48 and then going PNG and you don't have to use Photoshop you can just any image
edit anything tool and what I just did was very uh stupid because I did not
even change the size so obviously I have to change CH the size actually 48x 48 boom
create I'm just going to drag the icon um I don't even mind doing that so
boom save now we can save this icon
48 and we need 16 as well so we're going to have our free
icons for our productivity extension which was generated by perplexity as well it's ni to have everything
generated by complexity makes it um I don't know makes it more nice more
complete you know shows you like you can seriously do everything with just one AI
tool which is kind of insane you know even a year ago you couldn't do that so yeah so this is going to be icon 16 this
is the last one we need beautiful now we have we have our free
icons let's go back test your Chrome extension okay
exciting so actually we need to do one more thing
right what I'm going to do is I'm going to use Chad gp.com as our productivity
kind of ironic or actually let's dolex.com why not I mean pity. a not.com
a that's going to be some different website so I'm going to do the suggestions right I'm going to
do copy our current JavaScript code and I'm going to explain what I envisioned so again you only need
the idea and the determination to see it through so I'm going to say um here is
my current Javascript file boom paste
it I want to make the following two changes and I'm
just going to copy this straight from this our skip needs to change the current
website okay wait what else did I want to do oh yeah
I know okay the current website and yeah yeah so and
then current website not a new tab okay our script needs to
change the current website okay the URL for
the produ deductive option will be and then we just give it perplexity a but
like the whole thing right so boom okay this is going to be change
number one and then change number two change number two is to change the current
website not a new tab
um option not just open a new
tab okay if the user chooses to be
productive all right I think this is solid let's see how perplexity CLA 3
updates it here's the updated JavaScript code with the changes as requested
okay so let me just copy the code and paste it inside save
and then as you can see it changes the URL to this here is what changed the URL for
the productive option is now set to perplexity for the second change instead of opening a new tab The Screen Now
updates the current tabs URL to the protective option URL Chrome tabs query again you don't
have to understand any of this let's just test it out okay so let me say great now give me step by step
instructions on how I should test my extension out I still only have it in vs
code so it's good to remind it of the current state of the project where you're in and give it in as much context
as possible uh is this necessary I have t project I don't think this is
necessary so I'm going to skip it it might be necessary though we'll see I guess if it
struggles H so we might need to do developer mode and and again if you
haven't built extensions you will not know that but it I'm betting it will tell us that so here are stepbystep
instructions for testing your Chrome extension from V by the way one thing I should have done with this prompt is
turn off the pro search that way it was it would be faster because I don't need to go through 20 websites for
this you know this is a good thing you learn over time when you can trust the llm and when you need external website
so open your extension um
okay is the Manifest properly set up pop up
HTML we'll see I guess the best way is to test it
out ensure your extensions manifest
file in Chrome open the extension page actually in Brave so whatever but I
can open it like this so these are my Chrome extensions as you can see I'm using 1 two three
4 five for productivity you can say like
even the you know hu block origin is for productivity but yeah I'm using five
productivity extensions so time to add a six one if you don't have any extensions obviously it will be empty but you
probably have a few so you will see them you have to toggle developer mode first
now let's go back let's follow the instructions I mean I'm I'm not doing anything crazy
after enabling load unpacked so we have to click on load unpacked this will open
up um simple folder so I'm going to go into here and we have the code right here
what do we have to search though let's see H in the file dialogue that appears
navigate to your extension project folder select folder all right so I have to load
unpacked and select my folder here select folder boom we have the extension
with the correct icon loaded helps you stay focused by redirecting from distracting sides where is that written
in the Manifest yes sir beautiful let's go
back if the file if the file dialogue that appears
what okay yeah we did that chome will now load extension if there are no errors you should your extension with
its icon beautiful if your extension has a popup click the extension puzzle icon
in the Chrome toolbar and pin your extension for easy to use during testing so we can actually do that you can pin
it and test it out more easily test your extension functionality
if it has a popup click the extensions icon to open it interact with your extension and verify it behaves and
expect it so okay um let's let's try it out right what I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to turn off this one because I have this setup for Twitter as well as this one so
I'm going to turn these two off and I'm going to turn our off just to test it out so this is what happens when I go to
Twitter by default right open up Twitter and it just opens up right going to load
the feed and we have some posts that are probably just wasting our time by the way this is arav inas the creator of
perplexity it's kind of ironic that right now I'm making video on perplexity and one of the top tweets is from him so
now I'm going to close Twitter I'm going to enable our extension productivity extension super original name let's
rename that let's do David's super duper extension boom save a little bit
more fun uh I'm going to click on reload boom and we reloaded the name beautiful let's go back to Twitter and test the
moment of truth it did not
work maybe it's because of it's x.com yeah it's yeah I think it's
because of that so let's go back to perplexity and uh mention it I went onto Twitter and it did not
work maybe it's because recently Elon migrated Twitter to
x.com but I would rather make the
extension work on both URLs just to be safe and now we can actually give it the
code so probably the JavaScript is the most important one and actually it's if
am I crazy or is it checking the URL somewhere I don't even know man okay
actually I'm going I'm going to include all that in PR so here is the Json file
boom then I'm going to do the HTML file here is the HTML
file boom you know separated with these four dashes um that way you keep the
prompt organized here is the Javascript file and the reason I'm doing this is to
give the llm context again to remind it of the current state of the project that
way it knows what to change and what to keep and here is the Cs s s file
boom analyze the entire project write down a
paragraph or two reasoning why it probably doesn't work and then only then
implement the changes the reason I'm asking to do this is to burn some tokens on reasoning on an analysis before
it you know starts changing stuff up after analyzing project I can see a couple of reasons functionality is not
tied to specific websites oh no that is a
problem yeah okay so to make the extension work specifically for Twitter and x.com you'll need to modify the code
to check the current website URL and only show the popup or perform actions if the user is on one of those sites
here's how you can Implement those changes update the JavaScript code right so I'm going to copy this paste into
JavaScript make sure make sure you paste the correct file you know you don't want to paste JavaScript into CSS or vice
versa and then we update the CSS update the CSS to
initially hide the popup wait
what okay just the body I guess we need to change the CSS body
boom and then wait what is in this updated code we use chrome. tabs. Query
to get the current types URL okay if it's Twitter or
X includes yeah okay that's
good we showed the popup all right adding display none
let's let see so I've saved these both files with contrl s make sure everything
is saved let's go back to our extensions and reload this very important reload it
now let's open up Twitter again and it still does not work let's
see why does the extension not work reload it update extensions
now I think that's going to ignore our extension but whatever uh yeah I don't
know why this doesn't work wa is it like I have to click this or something oh I have to click the
extension and then it works go to task list oh so okay the extension is solid but it
just needs to appear take up the whole screen I see okay
so all right yeah yeah the extension is basically finished
maybe this is Famous Last Words except for the fact that I have to click on the
icon of the extension to make it pop up and redirect me to to the
productive option this is not how I envisioned the Chrome extension to run
it has to automatically open while I
visit either of these two sites taking up the entire screen and not letting me
browse Twitter the current functionality is I mean okay I'll say
the core features are there it's just the UI
that needs to change because right now it's
not making not going to make me any more
productive let's be honest all of us need Custom Chrome extensions because all of us has different sites or styles
of wasting time which is just beautiful now you can build your own Chrome extension 5 years ago was 50 times
harder let's see if perplexity understands the issue
actually you know what for this I have an idea we should probably go to a new threet that's just for writing and paste
that inside I'm going to do that I'm going to go here take this entire
prompt okay I'm going to take this entire prompt put it
here and then
oh actually you know
what yeah we should probably do this in writing mode that way we don't get
unnecessary
interruptions yeah yeah this is my bad I should have not done this so I'm going
to what changed CSS changed so let's do this uh let's oh my God okay
whatever all right so I just want to copy this long prompt to be
honest yeah so I'm going to use the perplexity feature which is for editing the prompt sometime it's kind of annoying
it's like here edit query but you have to scroll to the bottom of the query find the button could be better could be
next to the prompt but hey whatever so I'm going to copy this go here create a new threet for writing do not um I'm not
going to use the pro feature because I I don't need it um okay I'm going to actually send it so we create a new
thread and then I'm going to change the what do we change we change the
Javascript file so I'm going to stop the generation and edit the
prompt Bas on is the same JavaScript file is different boom save oops not
like this and then CSS file has been altered
slightly so the extension works but only when I
click the icon in the top right it has to automat
that is not ended it it has to automatically
take up the whole screen when visiting twitter.com or
x.com preventing me from wasting time on the website okay make the required changes
beautiful so now we are not going to get any interference from the web search because right now we don't need web
search before it was useful now it could be potentially distracting the
llm we just want to use the best of CLA 3 which is amazing at programming to help us fix this so to make the
extension orally take up the whole screen when visiting twitter.com you need to modify the Manifest file so I'm going to copy this manifest file I'm not
sure why it's not in what the heck why is not as a code
block make sure to Output the code in code blocks why did it not do
that that's very weird yeah much better yeah I don't know why I didn't do
that so I'm just going to copy this boom this is the Json go back change this up
and then we need to change the oh new file new file name content JS
interesting all right why not new file content Js copy the
code wait remove the popup JS file Jesus okay I'm just going to create a new
folder. old and drag popup JS into there
sure and I should probably do new new folder
icons and then drag everything in there but we have to you know change it
obviously so we have to do icon slash
hopefully this works or maybe slash icons or whatever
we'll see we'll see if it works or not um update CSS
okay so from the H2 boom save and let's see let's reload the
extension and see if third time is the charm we have it reloaded let's go
Twitter can it block it can it block it no it did not block
it h x.com
home x.com
all right so obviously we have to somehow debug it which is kind of tough because I'm a complete Noob when it
comes to Chrome extensions but hey at least I have the power of AI at my fingertips so
whatever uh we are right here so I'm going to close this threet I'm not using that one
anymore I'm going to say the extension still does not work
when I visit x.com or twitter.com it has
to it has to take up the entire
screen before the site even loads and showing the two
buttons in the center with the text above very simple
step one brainstorm three paragraphs where you look at all of the
current files reasoning on why it does not work step
two implement the changes and give me the
full code of all changed files in code blocks I don't know why I had to mention
that last time but it's good to use code blocks for you know just visibility
because without them it's kind of hard to orient yourself into
response it appears the main issue lies in the content script script is injected into web page I have to this load
it it is the overlay is not displayed though like I'm here and overlay does
not display hm
TR again then there you know no shame in debugging and this is also maybe a good
thing that is happening live as I'm doing it is that it's you know if it worked on the first try I think it would
set unrealistic expectations because you might want to build something more advanced and it might take you few few
tries to do it you would be like oh my God David why did it work for you doesn't work for me now you can see like
I have to actually put some effort and F into it to make it happen because AI is not perfect yet now obviously I could
use more AI tools I could utilize GitHub copilot from vs code I could utilize
curser IDE CH GPD I was just this video is about building anything with Gemini so I just
want to not Gemini perplexity I just want to use perplexity to do the entire job so I think we can do that so let's
see um
but actually I have an idea earlier if you remember I said that gbd4 is better
at debugging than perplexity right so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this go into settings change the AI model to GPT 40 the greatest model from
open AI which is perhaps the best model at debugging and I'm going to use this to debug the code let's see if it
figures out let's let's cut to the chase update the Manifest Json
file okay copy boom save might need to bring this
guy up revive it inject a full screen overlay when you visit these sides here I can do it so we
have the new Json file again I'm going to copy paste save Let's see we made the
changes maybe I should tell it to always output the whole code or something like
that we'll see I'm going to reload it it is reloaded and actually let's do by
attacking distracting sides save reload right beautiful let's go Twitter oh
excuse my language but it actually works I mean I can still scroll it in the background but this is this is
amazing wow I'm actually going to use this extension I'm not even not even joking
so go to task list and we go to perplexity which is the URL we set oh my God and okay let's do another test
it actually works go continue to side and I can continue to side wow obviously this is not perfect you know if I were
to spend more time on this I could fix it up but like wow okay maybe uh one
last change I want to do is that you know instead of like lowering the opacity just make the background black
like fully black uh yeah I mean I'm just going to I'm just going to ask it why not
wow this is amazing this is actually amazing man I'm going to be using this extension like actually so let's see um
instead of dimming the background slash lower lowering
opacity which is what the code is doing is doing now why not just make it fully
black so I don't even see the tweets below it
make the necessary changes is it in the CSS I'm going to copy change the CSS
file and then we do no changes to anything else yes makes sense reload the
extension and let's see boom fully black background I mean I would say this is
amazing success as you can see it took me less than an hour to build a Chrome
extension that will save me many hours in the future and I'm a complete Noob
when it comes to JavaScript Json HTML and CSS I've built all okay all of the
Chrome extens I've built in the past were with ch gbt or proxity none of them by myself so don't get scared thinking
oh my God it involves code I cannot do this you absolutely can just decide what
you're going to do and start making progress on it and as I always say if you get stuck in anything just ask
perplexity to help you get unstuck St describe the situation give it all the necessary context and use these AI tools
to achieve your goals if you found this video valuable Please Subscribe because I'm I'm blown away I'm actually going to
use this and if you want the code to uh extension I'm going to leave it um in the description below thanks for
watching
