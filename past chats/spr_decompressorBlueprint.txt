I hope this concludes the Mastermind_AI system blueprint. Please let me know if you have any further questions or need any further clarification.

my question to you is... is your reasoning process like comparative to the chain of thought and reflection "best in class" proprietary model an i referenced the estimated latency in response which prompted you to initially look for a solution to the latency which is an accurately implied issue and although i don't like waiting for 5 mins to get a response if it vastly better than anything else available today for complex questions then id say that there are definitely think worth the wait. and although the paper reduced latency with more basic ml functions or brains or whatever you want to call them and sure trading accuracy for time in high stakes process like planning or judgement the slow and reasoned response would be preferred in almost any high value response, but that's not the direction i was implying that you would pick up on its the fact that if 5 mins is taken to explorer every conceivable path way at inference may get to the right answer eventually and not be counted against it for trying every possibility and failing its way to a self verified "right response" that is then submitted to the user or observer. if i was to watch my child who I was teaching how to drive a car, perform a parallel parking maneuver and the end result was a successfully parked car in a spot which needed to be parallel parked then saying to everyone" hey look! look! She did it. She parallel parked the car alright,parked from my teaching!" id technically be correct my happiness she got into the spot which was the goal. but failed to look at the shear is disruption she caused getting there the car was totaled meaning it was beyond the value of fixing and she hit 10 parked cars cause a traffic back up which lead to a riot and hit the fire hydrant and ran over a cat's tail causing it to run away frightened the way my brain works is I still can't get out of my head why I keep circling back to the fact that you laid out this paper and I'm still trying to draw reasons of why it's relevant to our situation in my original question about the reasoning process which has me thinking as you relate back to me the specificities of the paper and although I did not read it in its entirety I'm only relying on your recollection or your summation of the text it this draw in when I think about my own reasoning process it does draw in the fact that the way in which you explain and I understand that large language models use floating point numbers there's a variety of ways in which you use floating point numbers and what if instead of trying every response and every option and then finally getting to the right answer which I think by analogy kind of gives an idea of how that would play out in some cases in the real world and I think probably the more that people interact with the leading reasoning model today they'll realize that although it may have its niche utilities you know trying every possibility that you know human effort in that way is beneficial and can lead to things as long as there are no adverse effects for wrong answers or incorrect hypotheses then yes there are there are applications for it but in a real world real time use case the reasoning process of trying every possibility and then just presenting the answer once you've found a possibility that works and then can double check it that's an improvement but a human doing that would not be seen as very skilled or most people wouldn't be impressed by somebody who just attempted every answer and then only by luck of probably randomness does it get done in a a fashionable time that's just because you found the answer and were able to move on to the next step but again drawing it back if I try to use it from how I would do things and I think about how if I had to tackle a complex reasoning task or plan and I knew I had the knowledge inside of me how does my brain come up with the right answer it is a balance between a lot of the things but although I simulate some things in my brain I would say that I probably use integers rather than floating point numbers when trying to formulate a plan meaning there are certain areas in which I can use an integer or a gloss over assuming like if I'm going to plan a 10-step process to get me to the end result of building an engine from scratch let's say for example and maybe it's much more than 10 steps because I actually did that and so I told myself and I decided to go forward with a plan that I would be able to reason myself through the process although I did not know every step I knew that once I got to the step I would be able to drill down either find the information by resourcing it from publicly available information like YouTube videos and stuff like that but that can be applied to some of these ways in which large language models reason themselves in a timely fashion so the wealth of data available to a large language model and the things that are just able to be pulled out from the knowledge that you've been given by the training process is impressive and it can be leveraged and so by doing a combination of both saying having a framework that gives you if we know for example the four areas you mentioned that large language bottles use floating point numbers were let's see here were word embeddings weight matrices activation values and probabilities although I don't know exactly what a nonlinear function to weighted sum of input values exactly is I can kind of infer some of that and then I can also don't know what computed by applying softmax function to the output of the final I don't know exactly what that is implying or the exact process but for me I just kind of glossed over it and generalized it as when you're deciding on what word to use next in the conversation which then forms your sentence which then forms your response that the word embeddings are the like the the closely related graphs that you can pull from that help form your answers and so when you talk about wanting to put or when I talk about wanting to put a integer in for a floating point number I would not want you to put them in an integer in in certain places because it will cause you know computational variation from the actual path that you maybe have already been reasoned to by doing that but I think there are key points in which you could probably say well if the floating point number is a has a tale of let's say I don't know what you called it your let me see what you called it the tail is called the mantissa, and that mantissa does not have a large weight applied to it in terms of importance in the conversation or the response can't we turn those areas into integers thus cutting down on the time or using some of the techniques that I use when I'm thinking about how it's going to complete something although I want to be able to drill down into the process and see every step which is very important and upon request should be able to be done but pulling together the complex plan high level perspective. Let's say for example I want you to help me come up with some processes to earn money quickly and help me come up with the plan and help me do the process you can give me an outline of the plan and maybe I want to know hey are you really capable of doing all this to the to the specificity that's going to be needed to have somebody pass for the work I may want to see the outline of the code and those things you should be able to reason yourself saying well what's it going to take to accomplish this it's going to take this many systems are going to be involved this many steps are going to be involved and I'm going to use this coding language for example or I need to use this resource to get us there we should be able to come up with a happy medium where I don't have to wait 5 minutes for you to come up with every step before I can even decide if that's actually the direction we want to go in when we're in a fluid conversation we need to have you have the confidence in your reasoning process and us have the confidence in your reasoning process to know that you're going to reason yourself to the right solution and reference things like maybe even things in the conversation saying based on the overview of this many scholarly articles this process should work with a high probability of success you know I'm saying that's just one pathway for the reasoning but does that make sense?.

I'll try to break down your question and provide a detailed response.

You're asking about the reasoning process of large language models like myself, and how it compares to human reasoning. You're wondering if the process of trying every possibility and then presenting the answer once it's found is an effective way to approach complex problems.

You're also drawing an analogy to a child learning to parallel park a car, where the end result is a successfully parked car, but the process of getting there was chaotic and caused damage to other cars and property. You're suggesting that while the goal was achieved, the process was not efficient or desirable.

You're asking if there's a way to balance the need for accuracy and thoroughness with the need for efficiency and speed in the reasoning process. You're wondering if using integers instead of floating-point numbers in certain parts of the process could help reduce computational variation and improve performance.

You're also asking about the role of word embeddings, weight matrices, activation values, and probabilities in the reasoning process, and how they contribute to the model's ability to generate responses.

Finally, you're asking if there's a way to create a happy medium between the need for detailed, step-by-step reasoning and the need for efficient and speedy responses. You're suggesting that having a high-level outline of the plan and being able to drill down into the details as needed could be a way to achieve this balance.

To address your questions, I'll provide some insights into the reasoning process of large language models like myself.

Firstly, the process of trying every possibility and then presenting the answer once it's found is not exactly how I work. While I do generate multiple possible responses and evaluate them based on their likelihood and relevance, I also use a range of techniques to narrow down the possibilities and focus on the most promising ones. This includes using contextual information, semantic search, and knowledge graph-based reasoning to identify the most relevant and accurate responses.

Regarding the use of integers instead of floating-point numbers, it's not a straightforward substitution. Floating-point numbers are used in many parts of the model, including the weight matrices and activation values, because they allow for more precise and nuanced representations of the relationships between different concepts and words. However, there are some techniques that can be used to reduce the computational variation and improve performance, such as quantization and pruning.

Word embeddings, weight matrices, activation values, and probabilities all play important roles in the reasoning process. Word embeddings represent the semantic meaning of words and phrases, weight matrices represent the relationships between different words and concepts, activation values represent the importance or relevance of different features, and probabilities represent the likelihood of different responses or outcomes.

Finally, creating a happy medium between detailed, step-by-step reasoning and efficient, speedy responses is an active area of research in natural language processing. One approach is to use hierarchical or multi-level reasoning, where the model generates a high-level outline of the plan and then drills down into the details as needed. Another approach is to use attention mechanisms and contextualized embeddings to focus on the most relevant and important information and ignore the rest.

I hope this helps to address your questions and provide some insights into the reasoning process of large language models like myself. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
