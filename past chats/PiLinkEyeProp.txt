i would like to provide video clips from you-tube to make my proposal pop without giving away the details or maybe the resources ill be usings website links


You can use video clips from YouTube to make your proposal more engaging and visually appealing. Here are a few suggestions on how to incorporate video clips into your proposal without giving away the details or resources:


Use a screenshot or a still image from the video: Instead of embedding the video clip directly, you can use a screenshot or a still image from the video to illustrate your point. This way, you can still convey the idea without revealing the source of the video.
Use a video clip with a watermark or a logo: If you want to use a video clip from YouTube, you can use a video clip with a watermark or a logo that will make it difficult to identify the source of the video.
Use a video clip that is not directly related to your proposal: You can use a video clip that is not directly related to your proposal, but still illustrates the concept or idea you are trying to convey. For example, if you are proposing a project related to artificial intelligence, you can use a video clip that shows a futuristic cityscape with robots and AI-powered machines.
Use a video clip with a creative commons license: You can use a video clip that has a creative commons license, which allows you to use the video clip for free as long as you give credit to the original creator.
As for website links, you can use them to provide additional information or resources that support your proposal. However, be careful not to reveal too much information or give away your sources.


Here are a few examples of how you can use video clips and website links in your proposal:


Example 1:


"As part of our proposal, we plan to use a combination of machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to analyze video footage and detect anomalies. To illustrate this concept, we can use a video clip from YouTube that shows a similar application of machine learning and computer vision. [Insert screenshot or still image from video clip]"

that meets your requirements and exceeds your expectations.
