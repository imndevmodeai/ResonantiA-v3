null - null: 231830 in that case Mr
null - null: Gonzales is charged with resisting
null - null: obstructing a police
null - null: officer and assault and
null - null: battery that allegedly occurred
null - null: stuff
null - null: here at
null - null: 1824 which will about 624 in the
null - null: afternoon on August 3rd of 2023 in the
null - null: city of
null - null: sturis I signed an order for a
null - null: competency
null - null: evaluation last October
null - null: 31st and the defendant was evaluated for
null - null: competency at the center for forensic
null - null: psychiatry and I apologize Mr Gonzalez
null - null: these matters can often take a long time
null - null: the center for forensic psychiatry
null - null: is overburdened and underst
null - null: staffed uh at any rate we received a
null - null: report on May 23rd from a doctor at the
null - null: center for forensic psychiatry
null - null: Dr
null - null: J L Alexander Scott J Alexander Scott
null - null: MD uh the date of that is May 23rd we
null - null: received it on May
null - null: 28th by law we're supposed to schedule
null - null: this hearing within five days of receipt
null - null: of the order or the report which we have
null - null: done today is three days after we
null - null: actually got it date stamped Mr Marvin
null - null: on behalf of of the people are you
null - null: willing to stipulate to the report of Dr
null - null: Alexander yes I do I read the report and
null - null: I stipulate to the
null - null: findings Mr George I stipulate to the
null - null: findings your
null - null: honor all right this was an incident
null - null: there were actually two incidents on the
null - null: same day uh there's another file two4 -4
null - null: FY which also Alle allegedly occurred on
null - null: August 3rd of
null - null: 2023 now was at
null - null: 1348 which would be about
null - null: 1 48 in the afternoon so one of these
null - null: happened in the afternoon and the other
null - null: happened later in the
null - null: evening uh you were quite distraught and
null - null: distressed uh it resulted in charges
null - null: being filed of resisting and obstructing
null - null: the police
null - null: officers uh the doctor did quite a
null - null: thorough evaluation in this case uh I
null - null: was impressed with the thoroughness of
null - null: the report um he got a lot of sources of
null - null: information he talked to your mother he
null - null: did some testing he got uh information
null - null: from sturis hospital pivotal the
null - null: Intermediate School District the probate
null - null: court and uh
null - null: he had looked into a lot of your uh
null - null: medical and social history uh he also
null - null: looked at the medical reports from that
null - null: day
null - null: um and uh some other
null - null: dates and uh his opinion
null - null: is on page one it is my opinion to a
null - null: reasonable degree of medical certainty
null - null: that Mr Gonzalez is competent to stand
null - null: trial and I'll speak to that in a little
null - null: bit Mr Gonzalez there are sometimes two
null - null: components to a mental health defense in
null - null: a criminal case one is Criminal
null - null: responsibility sometimes referred to as
null - null: insanity and that is what was your state
null - null: of mind at the time of the
null - null: incident uh were you and I'm not saying
null - null: this is true but were you very
null - null: intoxicated were you high out of control
null - null: substance were you suffering from mental
null - null: illness or
null - null: delusion uh what was your state of mind
null - null: at the time of the offense that's not
null - null: what this is about this is about
null - null: competency which is what is your state
null - null: of mind right now
null - null: today and can you assist in your defense
null - null: and do you understand the nature of the
null - null: charges against
null - null: you this doctor did quite a uh competent
null - null: report where he sets out why he thinks
null - null: that you're
null - null: competent the following evidence
null - null: supports my opinion Mr Gonzales trusts
null - null: his attorney to work in his best
null - null: interest and is willing to work
null - null: collaboratively
null - null: collaboratively that's a hard word to
null - null: say with them and discuss all the
null - null: details of the case despite his
null - null: assertion that he has a poor memory of
null - null: the events of the arrest Mr Gonzalez
null - null: understands that the events May Be
null - null: reconstructed through very ious sources
null - null: of evidence sources which he was able to
null - null: list Mr Gonzalez is able to understand
null - null: the strength of the evidence against him
null - null: and can realistically appraise the
null - null: likely outcomes of his case Mr Gonzalez
null - null: shows the ability to rationally make
null - null: decisions about entering a plea
null - null: indicating his ability to assist in
null - null: planning a legal
null - null: strategy Mr Gonzalez holds no delusional
null - null: beliefs about courtroom
null - null: participants Mr Gonzalez demonstrates
null - null: sufficient attention concentration and
null - null: memory Mr Gonzalez has adequate adaptive
null - null: abilities and demonstrates the ability
null - null: to learn about the nature of his charges
null - null: and various parties in the courtroom Mr
null - null: Gonzalez has no present symptoms that
null - null: would impair his ability to conduct
null - null: himself according to the requirements of
null - null: the courtroom
null - null: I understand that the ultimate decision
null - null: in this matter L rests on a Judicial
null - null: determination that's
null - null: me but in summary it is my opinion that
null - null: to a reasonable degree of medical
null - null: certainty that although Mr Gonzalez does
null - null: have autism spectrum disorder and
null - null: borderline intellectual
null - null: ability he remains despite this able to
null - null: understand the nature and object of the
null - null: proceedings against him and can assist
null - null: in his defense in IR
null - null: manner I would respectively ask the
null - null: court to consider allowing Mr Gonzalez
null - null: in the light of his conditions extra
null - null: time to consult with his attorney and to
null - null: comprehend comprehend the court
null - null: proceedings as they
null - null: occur uh Mr Gonzalez did you hear
null - null: everything I said
null - null: no you did not hear everything I said no
null - null: I did oh you did hear okay now you were
null - null: Cooperative with the officer I mean with
null - null: the hearing uh doctor and uh he valued
null - null: that
null - null: cooperation uh you have not been in any
null - null: trouble since this happened last
null - null: August uh this order was entered in
null - null: October are you still living in
null - null: Sturges is that yes and is your mother
null - null: still your legal
null - null: guardian yes what kind of things have
null - null: you been doing to keep
null - null: busy playing some video games with my
null - null: mother here and there just a by
null - null: time all right do you watch television
null - null: shows
null - null: sometimes all right
null - null: um do you go out and get any exercise or
null - null: anything walk or ride a bike
null - null: okay all right are you on any medication
null - null: right
null - null: now yes and are you taking them all as
null - null: prescribed yes all right and are you
null - null: ready to move forward with these
null - null: cases
null - null: yes all right uh based on the thorough
null - null: report provided by Dr Alexander
null - null: Scott uh and my brief discussions with
null - null: the defendant I am of the opinion that
null - null: the fendant is competent and we can move
null - null: forward to the next stage of the
null - null: proceedings in both of these cases Mr
null - null: George do you have any objection to that
null - null: no you're
null - null: not uh Mr Marvin
null - null: no all right Juan these cases have been
null - null: on uh whole for a
null - null: while uh and you are on medication I I
null - null: find that the defendant is competent to
null - null: stand trial the case shall continue to
null - null: the next stage of the criminal process
null - null: the defendant is receiving medication
null - null: the defendant in order to maintain
null - null: competen to stand trial shall be
null - null: administered appropriate medication
null - null: pending and during the trial if
null - null: necessary so we need to get these
null - null: cases on track there are two of them the
null - null: other case the one that occurred
null - null: at 148 in the afternoon is file
null - null: 24-40
null - null: FY that one has been on hold pending the
null - null: competency evaluation in this case one
null - null: that happened
null - null: at uh 6:30 at night so let's set both of
null - null: these and let's find a date that works
null - null: for you Mr George your honor can I ask
null - null: you something on that real quick I know
null - null: that when we had the PCC in that case
null - null: judge Patterson advised that we had to
null - null: do a separate order for competency in
null - null: that file is it sufficient that we could
null - null: just stipulate to the findings of this
null - null: report in that file as well yes thank
null - null: you I agree with that for efficiency's
null - null: sake let's get it done and wrap this
null - null: up step to the report for
null - null: 20440 fyf well as well
null - null: all right
null - null: um judge Patterson had pre-exams my
null - null: pre-exam day is next Tuesday that might
null - null: be too soon for everybody but uh that
null - null: would be June
null - null: 4th otherwise I would go to June
null - null: 18th let me make sure I got this right
null - null: no
null - null: June 11th I think is my pre-exam day is
null - null: that the day that would be the 12th your
null - null: yes okay I I'm here anyways your honor
null - null: all right we'll set
null - null: pre-exam no I've got sobriety court that
null - null: day um but I have pre-exams in the
null - null: morning so that's right for
null - null: Wednesday June
null - null: 12th at
null - null: 8:30 and if we need a pre- in either of
null - null: these if
null - null: needed will be
null - null: June
null - null: 18th Mr Gonzalez as a
null - null: consideration uh we allowed you to come
null - null: in by Zoom this morning your mother
