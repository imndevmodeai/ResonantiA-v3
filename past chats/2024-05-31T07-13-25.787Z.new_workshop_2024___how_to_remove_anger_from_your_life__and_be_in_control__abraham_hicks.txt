I want to ask for help with one thing
which is that uh I get
stuck uh with
anger uh when things when I have an
opinion about the way things should be
and they are different than my opinion I
can quickly especially um if somebody I
care about I feel like they're
threatened I go like I can go into
anger uh well it's logical we've been
saying to you all from the first time
that we presented the emotional scale to
you that anger certainly is higher on
the emotional scale than defeat or
despair or grief or fear and so if
something that is happening is making
you feel defeated on behalf of someone
else which means it's active in your
vibration too then anger is not a bad
step it's a step in the right direction
and even revenge is a step in the right
direction but the thing about it is if
you don't understand the resistance that
is present in anger so you don't do
something about continuing to move up
the emotional scale then you can develop
patterns that just hold you there and
the Law of Attraction this is the weird
thing that makes you all not like the
Law of Attraction The Law of Attraction
will bring you more things to to be
angry about you get angry on a regular
basis and fearful things won't show up
anymore and guilty things won't show up
anymore and blameful things won't show
up anymore but a whole lot of things to
be angry about will show up in your
experience if that's where you're
hovering on a pretty steady basis and um
I mean it's just sort of a need your
it's sort of where I I idle and I'm
I'm I function pretty well with a a a
base level of anger which is terrible I
I totally get that well we don't think
it's a base level we think it's a
knee-jerk level we don't think it's even
70% or even 60% your base level is way
different from that but it really sticks
out when it is there so when we say to
you it's really going to help you we say
to you you are where you are you feel
how you feel and how you feel is what
you get just let that settle in for a
little bit let it be a stronger
awareness
how I feel is how I feel and I've got
good reason to feel like this I didn't
make this up I've been following this
and this and this I feel this way for a
reason fine you could even go so far as
to say and I know I'm right I'm right
about feeling like this but still there
is a power in the path of most allowance
because in your narrower view of what is
right and wrong you are still
disconnected from your soul source and
that is the problem that's the
disempowering problem that's the I don't
feel good problem that's the out of
balance problem that's the diminishing
of well-being problem you can be right
by all standards but there's only one
standard that you really want to
calibrate to and that's who am I really
and what do I really
know and that is that I would rather
what's on the other end of the stick
from anger there's hate and love that's
easier to Define and there's confusion
and Clarity but what is on the better
feeling I I have a friend of mine who's
a pretty spiritually fit guy and he
always talks about this fact that um men
have this same capacity for creation and
destruction and the more anger or
destructive energy you have it's still
the other end of that stick is your
Creative Energy your ability to protect
and defend and create and help so the
anger is about my deprivation of my
power and on the other end of it is my
acknowledgement of my creative power
that's really good and what you're angry
about is that you're pinching away who
you really are over something that they
damn well should stop doing but when you
look at it not in terms of right and
wrong you see your inner being this is
important to get to remember your inner
being isn't doing that your inner being
is looking at the same thing you're
looking at and not pinching off from
Source energy your inner being is
accepting the right to be how this
person wants to be your inner being is
accepting that diversity is balance that
without it no one could choose that it
all helps focus and so as you get it
down to what really matters I'm choosing
to calibrate to this person and push
against this person rather than
calibrate to my inner being who isn't
pushing against this person and that's
where your creativity comes in if you
take one of the people or subject let's
just take government for example and
maybe you've got a real solid case to
push against some aspect of that if it's
possible and it usually is if you're
looking for easy existing matches if you
can find some benefit of government well
it's easy to have an opinion of how
they're wrong you can always almost
always have an opinion but I think it's
more would be different for me to have
an intention of how I'd like to see
government be right I don't know I you
lost me there well yeah or I lost myself
that's because it's a subject that most
people are so practiced in pushing
against government's complicated I'll
give you an example though of one of the
things that I got angry about uh I was
walking my dog in a park off the leash
in a park where hundreds of other dogs
are off the leash and a person with like
six dogs off leash they were a
professional dog walker threatened my
dog and I went berserk I like I I I
especially in my
family my wife my kids if I'm let's stay
focused on that for just a little bit so
you felt angry because felt that anger
come out your do felt in Jeopardy yeah
and I wanted to protect it what were you
angry about that person doing exactly
what you you were doing yes yeah that's
where I don't understand why I go to
that so quick and it has something to do
with being threatened and it I have that
same reaction if uh my wife isn't well
right now and if anybody even slights
her and the I have just feel this
protective well you're hitting upon the
most important conversation that we
could ever have together when we say to
you that self-interest is real what we
mean is you cannot see other than
Through The Eyes of self and you cannot
attract other than from self and so when
it in a flawed premise way appears that
someone else can threaten you it's such
a departure from what your inner being
really knows about the law of attraction
there is not a law of assertion there's
a law of attraction there is not a law
of assertion well Abraham you're making
me crazy the dogs were attacking my dogs
it looked like law of assertion to me it
was not law of assertion it was Law of
Attraction so then if you can just reach
a little bit to accept that then you
might begin asking well what's in my bag
of marbles do I actually have a
vulnerability that's going on Esther had
such a startling Awakening not that long
ago when she was visiting with someone
that she really really really really
really really really really
loves and this person was being
defensive with Esther and Esther thought
I don't deserve this I didn't say
anything I don't deserve this
defensiveness but she walked away from
it and she thought the law of attraction
is the law of attraction and the bag of
marbles is the bag of marbles and my
point of Attraction is my point of
attraction and if I'm getting
defensiveness I'm attracting
defensiveness how in the hell am I
attracting
defensiveness and once she accepted that
she must be because she was getting it
then she thought oh yeah I was kind of
thinking a little bit of that I wasn't
saying it out loud because I didn't want
to pick a fight but she got the fight
even though she didn't say it out loud
because it was active in her bag of
marbles and you all are so smart you
sniff out what's going on with each
other's marbles
you do and so you're roaming around in a
world where there are so many people
that are doing so many things most of
you it is logical that you would feel
defensive because there's so much going
on that you feel you can't control that
you don't know how to control because
you haven't really been exercising very
much deliberately your control we want
to hear you but let's just finish this
thought out let's say that you had that
experience with the aggressive dog
and rather than it feeling like they
were asserting into your experience you
accepted that you were attracting while
you really don't know how but you want
to know now that question is active
within you so your inner being will show
you when you have vulnerable feeling
thoughts your vulnerable thoughts will
just show up and when they do you can
stop and say rather than try to figure
out the rightness or the wrongness of
this what's the path of least resistance
of this and as you Shore that up a
little bit what you begin to notice is
that not only do you have fewer if
any moments in time where you feel that
you were vulnerable but you find
yourself just moving through life with
such a feeling of assurance and good
timing there are robbers all over your
streets there are people all over the
place getting ready to have a traffic
accident there are people stealing
things you're walking amongst all kind
kinds of things when Jerry first met us
he said Abraham I think there should be
an incarceration system where all the
burglars go to one Island and burgle
each other and all the rapers go to one
Island and rape each other and all the
murderers go to one Island and murder
each other and we said those islands
already exist they are vibrational
islands and he didn't like hearing it
and nether the people like you all that
we are telling because it feels like the
Raper is a different frequency than the
one who's being raped but it is not a
different frequency when you are
insecure that's when you become a bully
that's when you try to seek control it's
the same
vibration and so as these lovely animals
show you expose our friend said I didn't
think I had any of that going on until
it manifested in a bigger way well you
might not think you have any of that
going on until it manifests in a bigger
way but then you have an opportunity to
consider hey do I have a sense of
vulnerability and is is that why I'm
such a safeguard is that why I've
developed this attitude of protection
but you can't protect yourself or anyone
from your own point of Attraction ah you
just can't The Law of Attraction will
find a way to let what you don't want in
when what you don't want is active in
your vibration and so on the one hand
that feels a little vulnerable for a
minute because oh my God what my bag of
marbles no telling what's in there I've
been carrying it around my whole life
but but when you start clarifying it and
you start feeling better you begin to
feel more and more and
more in control of what your point of
Attraction is I have one more question
yeah we have no more time so we'll it's
all right we'll take it quickly how much
is enough well this is a trick question
for this reason if you are in alignment
with who you
are oh there's never enough that's why
you are eternal
but a lot of people ask that question
meaningi put up with all this stuff that
I can't bear anymore when should I just
walk away from it when have I taken
enough abuse that I should just not put
up with that and we say oh you should
give that up immediately the slightest
bit of Discord from your inner being is
enough but you have to come to be
sensitive enough to your guidance system
to know that a lot of people really
believe that there is gain in pain so
they're willing to put up with things
until they come to the realization
because the Law of Attraction won't
yield to them the gain they're looking
for in the pain but you have to get good
at Discerning what real pain is and what
real pain is is a disallowing of
something that you've asked for if
somebody you don't know calls you on the
telephone and says hello you don't know
me I'm just calling to tell you I will
never call you again you would not feel
pain and you would not say this is
enough it would just be nothing Burger
you wouldn't care about it at all you'd
say all righty then thanks for letting
me know but if someone you care about
says I'm not going to see you or speak
to you ever again you would feel the
Discord of that so what's the point
we're making when there is a strong
desire the absence of it pinches harder
you just have to figure out what your
desires are you are an uplifter and when
you are not uplifting you feel pain you
are a lover and when you are not loving
you feel pain and you can justify it in
whatever way you want you can give all
the reasons that you should not love
that or this or that or those but when
you are not loving you are depriving
yourself of something that you really
want that you were born wanting and that
every day of your life you showed
yourself you wanted it because when you
didn't feel love from someone you ask
for more and when you don't love when
you're not loving you want to be more
loving life is helping you sort it all
out you just got to figure out how to
utilize your guidance system to know
which end is up
