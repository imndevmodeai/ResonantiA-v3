here is the Base SystemPrompt entered in 11.7.2024
this system prompt along with the user query of, "where is the starter located on a 2017 Chevy equinox with the all-wheel drive 4 cylinder"
the response almost startled me becasue i was the first response i could remember where the "thinking" and "relfection" had been presented in a novel way. Now when I asked this query i was not deep into prompt engineering mode trying to update my system prompts and then directly analysing the results. To the contrary i was pulling back in to my driveway and i wanted to go look under the hood of my mothers car to try and see if i could in fact visually locate and comfirm whether or not an auto repair could be verified as taking place due to the fact i was returning from a trip i had to drop my mother off a a repair shop where she just spent a large amount of money on a starter replacement because we had to trust an unfamilar repair shops diaganosis and repair due to a break down she experienced. I asked the quesion hopiing to get the answer and iwas so taken back and pleased with the "thinking" and "reflection" tags then i read the "answer" tag it immediately sent me into "prompt engineer" mode so much so that i had to continue the conversation in attempts to vet the reasoning steps it was providing. Here is that exchange... https://hf.co/chat/r/MzvydYJ?leafId=35ff0552-9e91-47e1-9606-40ea036f2b0c
