PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN,  
 Plaintiff,  
 File No. 2022-1644-FH  v Hon. Pamela L. Lightvoet    
BENJAMIN JACOB LEWIS,  
 Defendant.  
Emanuel A. Awuta-Coker (P81352) Mary Anne Simmering (P83430)  Assistant Attorney General Asst. Public Defender  Financial Crimes Division 151 S. Rose, Suite 300  P.O. Box 30755 Kalamazoo, MI 49007  Lansing, MI 48909 (269) 250-5000  (517) 335-7560  
DEFENSE CLOSING FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARING  
Benjamin Jacob Lewis, Defendant, through counsel, submits the following written  closing argument following the Evidentiary Hearing held on October 4, 2023, as this Court  required.  
QUESTION PRESENTED  
Is Mr. Lewis entitled to present evidence of his affirmative defense of impossibility at  trial?  
PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
Mr. Lewis is charged with one count of Child Support – Failing to Pay, contrary to MCL  750.165. He was arraigned on the charge on April 10, 2023. On April 20, 2023, he waived his  preliminary examination, and his case was bound over to the Ninth Circuit Court. Pretrials were 
People v Lewis  
2022-1644-FH Page 1 of 7 
held in this case on May 23, 2023 and June 12, 2023. On July 24, 2023, a Settlement Conference  was held. The case was not resolved, and Defense Counsel filed a Notice of Impossibility  Defense. A copy was provided to the acting Attorney General, Attorney James Mequio, and an  electronic copy was emailed to the point of contact at the Attorney General’s office, Rebecca  Raquepaw. On July 25, 2023, Attorney General, Attorney Emanuel Awuta-Coker filed People’s  Motion in Limine stating that Defense had not asserted the defense of impossibility and  requesting that the Court prohibit any evidence at trial of the defense or hold an evidentiary  hearing in advance of the trial if Defense intends to assert this defense. At a motion hearing on  August 4, 2023, this Court granted in part the People’s motion and ordered an evidentiary  hearing be held October 4, 2023.  
Defense Counsel objected on the record to being required to hold an evidentiary hearing  on the issue prior to trial. This objection was overruled and the hearing was held. The Court  ordered Defense Counsel to provide the Court with bank records from Mr. Lewis’s two prior  bank accounts within 45 days of the hearing, and indicated that written closings were to be  submitted within 45 days of the bank records being provided.  
Printouts from Varo Bank were emailed to the Court and Attorney General on November  26, 2023. Forty-five days from November 26, 2023 is January 10, 2024.  
SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS  
Mr. Lewis is charged with failing to pay ordered child support from July 1, 2017 through  April 30, 2018 and from September 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022. 
People v Lewis  
2022-1644-FH Page 2 of 7 
As established through testimony at the hearing on October 4, 2023, Mr. Lewis’s home  was foreclosed on after a divorce, and he moved in with his parents around August 2017. His  younger brother suffered from brain cancer and had brain surgery in 2017. He lived with Mr.  Lewis from early 2016 through his death on July 28, 2019. Mr. Lewis was the primary caregiver  for his brother during this entire time, as the brain cancer affected his brother’s behavior in  sometimes concerning ways, including his brother spending 30 days in jail for an allegation of  domestic assault during this time.  
The home that Mr. Lewis was living in flooded in early 2018, and he was forced to move.  Providing full-time care for his brother and moving homes proved to be incompatible with  employment.  
While living with his parents in June of 2021, their home suffered a house fire. Mr. Lewis  and his parents were displaced to a hotel for a few weeks, then to a rental property with no public  transportation nearby from August 2021 to February 2022. The hotel and rental property were  paid for by Mr. Lewis’s parents’ insurance. During this time, Mr. Lewis’s driver’s license had  been suspended due to a plea to a possession of a controlled substance charge. Mr. Lewis had no  internet, no phone, and no transportation.  
Due to the controlled substance case referenced above, Mr. Lewis was in custody in late  May of 2022 for a short period of time. 
People v Lewis

APPLICABLE LAW  
An individual has a Constitutional right to present a defense under both the state and  federal Constitutions. US Const, Ams VI and XIV; Const 1963, art 1, § 13; People v Hayes, 421  Mich 271, 278, 364 NW2d 635 (1984).  
The case that specifically permits an affirmative defense of impossibility to the charge of  failing to pay child support is People v Likine (492 Mich 367, 823 NW2d 50 (2012)).  
The Likine Court notably states:  
In a criminal proceeding, the defendant has a constitutional right to have the  prosecution prove his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and to have a jury  determine his or her guilt or innocence, as well as the merits of the impossibility  defense, if applicable, in accordance with that standard of proof. These protections  are fundamental to a defendant's right to a jury trial. As the Supreme Court stated  in Stevenson v. United States: 
[S]o long as there is some evidence upon the subject [of whether the defendant was  guilty of manslaughter rather than murder], the proper weight to be given it is for  the jury to determine. If there were any evidence which tended to show such a state  of facts as might [support the defense], it then became a proper question for the  jury to say whether the evidence were true.... The evidence might appear to the  court to be simply overwhelming to show [the defendant's guilt], and yet, so  long as there was some evidence relevant to the issue of [the defense], the  credibility and force of such evidence must be for the jury, and cannot be matter  of law for the decision of the court.  
Indeed, “the right to present the defendant's version of the facts as well as the  prosecution's to the jury so it may decide where the truth lies” is equally  fundamental in a prosecution for the strict-liability offense of felony nonsupport  once the defendant has crossed the high evidentiary threshold required to present  the affirmative defense of impossibility to the jury. [Likine, 492 Mich at 407-08  (emphasis in bold added)].  
The Likine case was the first formal recognition that the affirmative defense of Impossibility  against a charge of Felony Non- Support is permissible and constitutionally required. The framework 
People v Lewis  
2022-1644-FH Page 4 of 7 
articulated by our Supreme Court is specific and clear. The Supreme Court described how the defense  may be presented at trial. Nowhere in Likine is there any directive for a dispositive pretrial motion in  limine. Likine does not state that the trial court functions as a gatekeeper on whether a defendant may  
present this affirmative defense at trial. That is important and confirms that pretrial evidentiary demands  cannot be used to prohibit or circumvent a defendant’s Due Process right to present a defense and to  testify, if he so chose, in his own defense at trial.  
Similarly with some other affirmative defenses, such as Defense of Others, the case law is clear  that this is also a question of fact for the jury and the evidence is to be weighed by the jury. As the court  demonstrated in People v Leffew (508 Mich 625, 643–44, 975 NW2d 896, 907 (2022)):  
Instructional errors that directly affect a defendant's theory of defense can infringe a  defendant's due process right to present a defense.” People v Kurr, 253 Mich App at 326- 327, 654 NW2d 651 (2002). That said, an affirmative-defense instruction is not automatic  upon request. “In order to properly raise the defense, the defendant has the burden of  producing ‘some evidence from which the jury can conclude that the essential elements  of [the defense] are present.’” People v Lemons, 454 Mich 234, 246, 562 NW2d 447  (1997), quoting CJI2d 7.6, commentary; see also People v Guajardo, 300 Mich App at  34-35, 832 NW2d 409 (2013); People v Crawford, 232 Mich App 608, 619, 591 NW2d  669 (1998).  
The defendant's burden is not a heavy one. United States v Johnson, 416 F3d 464, 467  (2005). “Even when the supporting evidence is weak or of doubtful credibility its  presence requires an instruction on the theory of defense.” United States v Garner,  529 F2d 962, 970 (1976). In short, a defendant who puts forward some evidence in support  of their affirmative-defense theory is entitled to an instruction on that theory. People v  Rajput, 505 Mich 7, 10-11, 949 NW2d 32 (2020); People v Riddle, 467 Mich at 124, 649  NW2d 30 (2002). “Once a defendant satisfies the initial burden of producing some  evidence from which a jury could conclude that the elements necessary to establish a  prima facie defense of [defense of others] exist, the prosecution bears the burden of  disproving the affirmative defense of [defense of others] beyond a reasonable doubt.”  People v Dupree, 486 Mich at 712, 788 NW2d 399 (2010). “The sufficiency of the  evidence of a defendant's [defense-of-others] theory is ‘for the jury to decide under proper  instructions....’” Rajput, 505 Mich at 11, (2020), quoting People v Hoskins, 403 Mich 95,  100, 267 NW2d 417 (1978). [People v Leffew, 508 Mich 625, 643–44, 975 NW2d 896,  907 (2022) (emphasis added).] 
People v Lewis  
2022-1644-FH Page 5 of 7 
ARGUMENT  
Mr. Lewis has a Constitutional right to present a defense at trial. US Const, Ams VI,  XIV; Const 1963, Art 1 §13. His Due Process rights, including his right to testify, will be  infringed, should the Court prohibit him from presenting a defense. The case law is clear that the  presentation of evidence for a defense of impossibility to a failing to pay child support claim  comes at trial. Mr. Lewis asserts, again, his objection to the Court requiring an evidentiary  hearing before trial.  
Mr. Lewis has the right to present his evidence of impossibility to the jury in trial. People  v Likine, supra. He has a right to the jury instruction detailing the elements of the defense to the  jury. Whether he meets the burden of the defense is a question of fact for the jury. This Court  ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence presented invades the province of the jury, as it is a  question of fact for the trier of fact, not a question of law for the Court.  
Even if this Court determines that it is proper for the Court to make a determination on  the sufficiency of the evidence to rule whether or not Mr. Lewis is allowed to present the  evidence at trial, he has presented evidence that a jury could determine is sufficient to meet the  elements of the defense. Further, while this Court may find the evidence weak, that is not  dispositive. See Likine, supra; Leffeww, supra. Instead, Likine confirms that Mr. Lewis’s Due  Process rights require that he be allowed to present this affirmative defense to the jury. The  weight of that evidence is to be weighed solely by the jury.

RELIEF REQUESTED  
Defendant asks this Honorable Court to deny the People’s motion in limine, and to allow  Mr. Lewis to proceed at trial with his defense, which includes the affirmative defense of  impossibility, to the properly instructed jury.

PEOPLE’S CLOSING ARGUMENT  
INTRODUCTION  
The People of the State of Michigan, by Dana Nessel, Attorney General, and  Emanuel A. Awuta-Coker, Assistant Attorney General, provide the following closing  argument in support of barring the Defendant from alleging impossibility as a valid  defense in the above matter. 
The Defendant was ordered to pay child support by the Kalamazoo County  Circuit Court, Case Number 2006006959DP. As consequences of neglect and  delinquent payment(s), the Defendant accumulated an arrearage of $7,774.95 as of  June 10, 2022. A Felony Warrant was issued at the Attorney General’s request for  Defendant’s Failure to Pay Child Support contrary to MCL 750.165.  
The Defendant claimed that it was impossible for him to pay his child  support obligation from July 1, 2017, through April 30, 2018, and from September 1,  2021, through May 31, 2022. The Court held an evidentiary hearing on October 4,  2023, to determine the validity of Defendant’s impossibility claim.  
ARGUMENT  
The Michigan Supreme Court, in People v Likine, 492 Mich 367 (2012),  established an affirmative defense of impossibility for the crime of Failure to Pay  Child Support. Likine, 492 Mich at 395. The Court outlined both the substantive  and procedural factors that should be considered if an impossibility defense is  alleged.  
Substantively, the Court held that to establish an impossibility defense, a  defendant must show that he or she acted in good faith and made all reasonable  efforts to comply with the family court order but could not so do through no fault of  his or her own. Likine, 492 Mich at 401. The Court goes on to state that “for the  payment of child support to be truly impossible, a defendant must explore and  eliminate all the reasonably possible, lawful avenues of obtaining revenue required 
to comply with the support order.” Id. at 402. A defendant's failure to explore every  reasonably possible avenue in order to pay his support obligation not only reflects  "an insufficient concern for paying the debt he owes to society," it also reflects an  insufficient concern for the child. Id. at 403. In those instances, the defendant may  not invoke the shield of the impossibility defense. Id.  
Turning to the procedural aspects of the impossibility defense, the Court  states that to be entitled to an impossibility instruction, the defendant must present  prima facie evidence from which the factfinder could conclude that it was genuinely  impossible for the defendant to pay support. Id. at 404. The defendant’s conduct in  family court proceedings is relevant to determining the possibility of compliance  with the support order and is relevant to evaluating the defendant’s good faith  efforts. Id. at 405. The Court further stated that evidence that the defendant was  “….voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, failed to exhaust all reasonable and  lawful means of generating the income necessary to satisfy the support obligation,  or failed to seek timely modification of the family court order when it became  evident that it could not be performed may, singly or in combination, defeat any  claim that it was impossible for the defendant to comply with the court order.” Id. at 405 – 06.  
 In this case, the Defendant has not shown that it was impossible for him to  pay his child support during the charging dates. During the first charging period,  July 1, 2017, through April 30, 2018, the Defendant was required to pay $358 in 
child support. This amount was reduced to $266 during the second charging period,  September 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022.  
At the Evidentiary Hearing, the Defendant testified that he was employed at  PNC Bank from approximately 2007 to 2015. During this time, he was making  approximately $50,000 annually. After he was terminated from PNC, the  Defendant testified that he obtained employment at a Ford dealership, a Chevrolet  dealership, a flower shop, and a discount retail store, from the years of 2016  through 2018. He also worked at a Chrysler dealership from April 2018 to  approximately April 2020. Although his specific income from these positions is  unknown, he testified that he earned from $30,000 to $37,000 annually from these  jobs.  
Significantly, he did not set money aside to ensure his child support  obligation was paid. He did not contact the Friend of the Court to notify them that  he could not pay his support. He did not file a motion to modify his obligation.  Instead, he testified that he had to take care of his brother and had other children  in his household. He did not prioritize his child support obligation, but rather chose  to commit his resources to other things. This does not show an impossibility to pay.  Instead, it shows that the Defendant did not arrange his finances in a way to ensure  that his support obligation was paid and that he placed other priorities before his  child support obligation.  
During the next charging period, September 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022,  the Defendant testified that he was placed on Felony Probation in March 2021. 
This was a result of his intentional misconduct. While on Probation, in February  2022, he violated his conditions of probation and was sent to Twin County Probation  Center for approximately 4 months. He was able to and did work while at the Twin  County program, but again, did not pay anything towards his child support  obligation. Instead, he paid his court costs.  
He claims he was verbally told he did not have to pay his child support, but  provided no court order or other document that excused him from his support  obligation. Again, he never contacted the Friend of the Court to modify his support.  He never filed any motion to have his support modified. He failed to explore every  possible avenue to ensure his support was paid. Instead, he is attempting to use  the inconvenience of being on Felony Probation as an excuse for not paying his child  support obligation. The Defendant should not be allowed to use any inconvenience  caused by placed on Felony Probation or for violating his probation as an  affirmative defense to his Failure to Pay his Child Support.  
Finally, the Defendant testified that that his home burned down and, as a  result, he had to live in a hotel that was paid for by his insurance. During the  charge dates, he also lived at a home owned by his parents. While living at this  house, he was not responsible for paying the mortgage and did not have to pay rent.  Again, despite not having these expenses, he chose to neglect his child support  obligation. 
CONCLUSION  
The Defendant provided various excuses for why he did not pay his child  support. However, none of these excuses are sufficient to show impossibility to pay  his support. The Defendant did not explore every possible avenue to earn sufficient  income to pay his support. He placed other priorities before his support obligation  and did not arrange his affairs and finances to ensure his support was paid. The  evidence presented may show an inability to pay his support obligation but fall well  short of showing impossibility. Therefore, this Court should bar the Defendant from  asserting an impossibility defense in this matter.

ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT'S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE OF IMPOSSIBILITY 
At a session of said Court held in the 
City and County of Kalamazoo, State of Michigan, on this 23 day of February 2024. 
Defendant, Benjamin Jacob Lewis, was ordered to pay child support by the Kalamazoo 
County Circuit Court, Docket No. 2006006959DP, and is now charged with one count of violating 
MCL 750.165, Child Support-Failure to Pay. Defendant failed to make child support payments 
for the periods July 1, 2017 through April 30, 2018 and September 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022, 
resulting in arrearages of $7,774.95. 
Pursuant to the Michigan Supreme Court's ruling People v Likine, 492 Mich 367, 
Defendant filed a Notice of Impossibility Defense. In Likine, the Court held that a defendant 
charged with criminal failure to pay child support may assert an affirmative defense of 
1 
impossibility. Id. at 395. The Court further stated that Defendant must show that he or she acted 
in good faith and made all reasonable efforts to comply with the family court order but could not 
do so through no fault of his or her own. Id. at 401. Moreover, the Court stated that "for the 
payment of child support to be truly impossible, a defendant must explore and eliminate all 
reasonably possible, lawful avenues of obtaining revenue required to comply with the support 
order." Id. at 402. The Court further stated: 
To determine whether a defendant has established impossibility in the context of a felony nonsupport case, we provide, for illustrative purposes only, a non-exhaustive list of factors for courts to consider. These should include whether the defendant has diligently sought employment; whether the defendant can secure additional employment, such as a second job; whether the defendant has investments that can be liquidated; whether the defendant has received substantial gifts or an inheritance; whether the defendant owns a home that can be refinanced; whether the defendant has assets that can be sold or used as loan collateral; whether the defendant prioritized the payment of child support over the purchase of nonessential, luxury, or otherwise extravagant items; and whether the defendant has taken reasonable precautions to guard against financial misfortune and has arranged his or her financial affairs with future contingencies in mind, in accordance with one's parental responsibility to one's child. The existence of unexplored possibilities for generating income for payment of the court-ordered support suggests that a defendant has not raised a true impossibility defense, but merely an assertion of inability to pay. A defendant's failure to explore every reasonably possible avenue in order to pay his or her support obligation not only reflects "an insufficient concern for paying the debt he owes to society, it also reflects an insufficient concern for the child. In those instances, the defendant may not invoke the shield of the impossibility defense. 
[Emphasis added.] Id. at 402-403. 
It must be noted that in its analysis, the Court stated that:

"[g]enerally, the commission of a crime requires both an actus reus and a mens rea. Though a strict-liability crime includes no mens rea element, the actus reus, or wrongful act, remains an element of the crime. Specifically, a strict-liability offense requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed 
2 
Id. at 393. 
the prohibited act, regardless of the defendant's intent and regardless 
of what the defendant actually knew or did not know. 
In this case, the Court held an evidentiary hearing and requested additional 
documentation/bank records from the Defendant. Impossibility is based on something that is 
outside of the Defendant's control. Defendant has clearly struggled financially in recent years and 
lost money, his home, various jobs, etc. However, in general, his life circumstances were not 
caused by actions outside of his control like a seizure, or loss of consciousness, or physical 
restrictions not of his own making that prevented him from supporting his child. To the contrary, 
his decisions/his own choices caused him to struggle as he picked up a criminal charge, lost his 
license, was placed on probation and/or entered into rehab. 
Furthermore, although understandable, Defendant is the one who chose to stay at home to 
care for a sibling for years without pay. His actions may be commendable, but they were also 
detrimental to the obligations he had to support his children. Defendant has certainly faced difficult 
decisions, and many of his choices have not made his life easy, however, the Court rejects his 
claim of impossibility as his situations were not due to some involuntary act(s) outside of his 
control. Rather, as a parent, he could have (and should have) made different choices to help 
support his children. Defendant's failure to explore every reasonably possible avenue in order to 
pay his child support does not shield him from his main responsibility as a parent- to support his 
child(ren). 
Wherefore, the Court's previous Order Granting the People's Motion in Limine remains 
and Defendant is precluded from submitting evidence at trial regarding an Impossibility Defense.

Defendant, Benjamin Jacob Lewis, was ordered to pay child support by the Kalamazoo 
County Circuit Court, Docket No. 2006006959DP, and is now charged with one count of violating 
MCL 750.165, Child Support-Failure to Pay. Defendant failed to make child support payments 
for the periods July 1, 2017 through April 30, 2018 and September 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022, 
resulting in arrearages of $7,774.95. 
Pursuant to the Michigan Supreme Court's ruling People v Likine, 492 Mich 367, 
Defendant filed a Notice of Impossibility Defense. In Likine, the Court held that a defendant 
charged with criminal failure to pay child support may assert an affirmative defense of 
1 
impossibility. Id. at 395. The Court further stated that Defendant must show that he or she acted 
in good faith and made all reasonable efforts to comply with the family court order but could not 
do so through no fault of his or her own. Id. at 401. Moreover, the Court stated that "for the 
payment of child support to be truly impossible, a defendant must explore and eliminate all 
reasonably possible, lawful avenues of obtaining revenue required to comply with the support 
order." Id. at 402. The Court further stated: 
To determine whether a defendant has established impossibility in the context of a felony nonsupport case, we provide, for illustrative purposes only, a non-exhaustive list of factors for courts to consider. These should include whether the defendant has diligently sought employment; whether the defendant can secure additional employment, such as a second job; whether the defendant has investments that can be liquidated; whether the defendant has received substantial gifts or an inheritance; whether the defendant owns a home that can be refinanced; whether the defendant has assets that can be sold or used as loan collateral; whether the defendant prioritized the payment of child support over the purchase of nonessential, luxury, or otherwise extravagant items; and whether the defendant has taken reasonable precautions to guard against financial misfortune and has arranged his or her financial affairs with future contingencies in mind, in accordance with one's parental responsibility to one's child. The existence of unexplored possibilities for generating income for payment of the court-ordered support suggests that a defendant has not raised a true impossibility defense, but merely an assertion of inability to pay. A defendant's failure to explore every reasonably possible avenue in order to pay his or her support obligation not only reflects "an insufficient concern for paying the debt he owes to society, it also reflects an insufficient concern for the child. In those instances, the defendant may not invoke the shield of the impossibility defense. 
[Emphasis added.] Id. at 402-403. 
It must be noted that in its analysis, the Court stated that:

"[g]enerally, the commission of a crime requires both an actus reus and a mens rea. Though a strict-liability crime includes no mens rea element, the actus reus, or wrongful act, remains an element of the crime. Specifically, a strict-liability offense requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed

Id. at 393. 
the prohibited act, regardless of the defendant's intent and regardless 
of what the defendant actually knew or did not know. 
In this case, the Court held an evidentiary hearing and requested additional 
documentation/bank records from the Defendant. Impossibility is based on something that is 
outside of the Defendant's control. Defendant has clearly struggled financially in recent years and 
lost money, his home, various jobs, etc. However, in general, his life circumstances were not 
caused by actions outside of his control like a seizure, or loss of consciousness, or physical 
restrictions not of his own making that prevented him from supporting his child. To the contrary, 
his decisions/his own choices caused him to struggle as he picked up a criminal charge, lost his 
license, was placed on probation and/or entered into rehab. 
Furthermore, although understandable, Defendant is the one who chose to stay at home to 
care for a sibling for years without pay. His actions may be commendable, but they were also 
detrimental to the obligations he had to support his children. Defendant has certainly faced difficult 
decisions, and many of his choices have not made his life easy, however, the Court rejects his 
claim of impossibility as his situations were not due to some involuntary act(s) outside of his 
control. Rather, as a parent, he could have (and should have) made different choices to help 
support his children. Defendant's failure to explore every reasonably possible avenue in order to 
pay his child support does not shield him from his main responsibility as a parent- to support his 
child(ren). 
Wherefore, the Court's previous Order Granting the People's Motion in Limine remains 
and Defendant is precluded from submitting evidence at trial regarding an Impossibility Defense.
