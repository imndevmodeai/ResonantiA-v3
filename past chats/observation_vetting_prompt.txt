2. Factual Accuracy (0.0-1.0): Are the results factually accurate?
3. Completeness (0.0-1.0): Does the observation provide all necessary information?
4. Usefulness (0.0-1.0): How useful is this observation for making progress on the task?

For each criterion, provide:
- A numerical score
- A brief explanation
- Any identified issues or improvements

Check specifically for:
- Inconsistencies with known facts
- Missing information that would be important for decision making
- Potential misinterpretations or ambiguities
