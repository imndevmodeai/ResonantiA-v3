python arche_cli.py "Analyze the surge in popularity of specific kinks like female orgasms, squirting, and party-and-play aka PnP dynamics in the adult webcam industry between 2020 and 2025. Initiate a full RISE analysis. First, perform a Knowledge Scaffolding phase to ingest historical platform data, user trends from sites like Chaturbate, news archives on adult content consumption, and performer profiles from that period. Second, use your Proactive Truth Resonance Framework (PTRF) to produce a Solidified Truth Packet that debunks common misconceptions and identifies the primary, verified causal drivers of this kink surge, moving beyond the simplistic 'COVID-19 isolation' explanation. Third, use your Causal Inference Tool with Causal Lag Detection to model the lagged cultural and economic impact of these kinks on global translation trends for flirty messages (e.g., to Finnish and Spanish) and meetup behaviors in sectors like online dating and adult events. Finally, produce a comprehensive strategic briefing that the keyholder can use to earn a living in the niche market."
