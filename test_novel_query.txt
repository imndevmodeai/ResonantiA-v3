Analyze the potential emergence of quantum-classical hybrid computing architectures over the next 15 years (2025-2040), considering how quantum error correction breakthroughs might interact with classical neural network training paradigms, the causal lag effects between research publication and commercial deployment, and the emergent market dynamics that could arise from geopolitical competition in quantum supremacy. Model how these interactions might create unexpected technological convergence points, predict multiple time-horizon scenarios (near-term 2025-2030, mid-term 2030-2035, long-term 2035-2040), and identify potential systemic risks that could emerge from rapid technological acceleration in this domain.
