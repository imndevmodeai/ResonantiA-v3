You are an expert at deciphering compressed symbolic representations and technical documentation.

I have a Zepto SPR (Sparse Priming Representation) - a hyper-compressed symbolic form of a technical specification document.
Your task is to decompress and decipher it, reconstructing the original meaning and structure.

Zepto SPR (compressed specification):
OGE:⟦→⦅→⊢→⊨→⊧→Assemble→◊

Symbol Codex Entries (for reference):
{
  "⊢": {
    "symbol": "⊢",
    "meaning": "SPR Activation - keyword lookup, triggering pattern matching and symbol activation.",
    "context": "Objective Generation Engine Workflow"
  },
  "⟦": {
    "symbol": "⟦",
    "meaning": "Query Intake - raw user query, denoting the initial input for objective generation.",
    "context": "Objective Generation Engine Workflow"
  },
  "⦅": {
    "symbol": "⦅",
    "meaning": "Feature Extraction - pattern matching in objective generation.",
    "context": "Objective Generation Engine Workflow"
  },
  "◊": {
    "symbol": "◊",
    "meaning": "Zepto Objective - pure symbolic form",
    "context": "Pattern Crystallization Meta-Process, Objective Generation Engine Workflow"
  },
  "⊧": {
    "symbol": "⊧",
    "meaning": "Template Assembly - string substitution",
    "context": "Pattern Crystallization Meta-Process, specifically the Symbolic Vocabulary for Objective Generation"
  },
  "⊨": {
    "symbol": "⊨",
    "meaning": "Mandate Selection / Domain Customization - rule-based",
    "context": "Objective Generation Engine Workflow"
  }
}

Original specification was approximately 48,272 characters.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the Zepto SPR structure and symbols carefully
2. Decompress it back to readable, comprehensive text
3. Explain what the original specification was about
4. Identify key concepts, architecture, components, stages, and technical details
5. Reconstruct the specification structure (sections, parts, stages, etc.)
6. Identify the 8-stage crystallization process if present
7. Extract any code examples, symbolic representations, or implementation details
8. Provide a detailed summary of the decompressed content

Format your response as:
## Decompressed Specification Content
[Full decompressed text - reconstruct as much as possible]

## Analysis & Deciphering
[Your analysis of what the specification means, its purpose, and structure]

## Key Concepts Identified
[List of key concepts, components, stages, processes]

## Technical Details
[Technical architecture, implementation details, code structure, etc.]

## Specification Structure
[The structure of the original specification - sections, parts, stages]

## Compression Analysis
[How effective was the compression? What information was preserved? What was lost?]
