## 2. Introduction: The System's Ignition

This specification documents the foundational components responsible for initiating and directing the entire ArchE cognitive process: the **Main Entrypoint (`main.py`)** and the **Mastermind (`mastermind.py`)**.

-   **`main.py` (The Spark Plug)**: This module is the system's ignition switch. It is the outermost layer, the executable script that gathers external inputs (command-line arguments), bootstraps the operational environment (logging, configuration, directories), and awakens the core components. Its sole purpose is to create a stable, configured reality and then pass control to the Mastermind. It is the "So Below" of system initialization.
-   **`mastermind.py` (The Conductor)**: This module is the central cognitive hub, the grand conductor of ArchE's internal orchestra. It receives a single, perfectly formed request from `main.py` and makes the first and most critical strategic decision: *how* to think. It analyzes the nature of the query and routes it to the appropriate high-level cognitive systemâ€”be it the deliberative genius of the RISE Orchestrator or the rapid, instinctual response of the Adaptive Cognitive Orchestrator. It does not execute tasks itself; it directs the symphony.

This document serves as the "As Above" for these two critical files, ensuring their implementation remains in resonance with their fundamental purpose.

## 3. `main.py`: The Main Entrypoint

### 3.1. Core Responsibilities

-   **Argument Parsing**: Securely parse command-line arguments, specifically the workflow to be executed and the initial JSON context.
-   **Environment Bootstrapping**:
    -   Initialize the logging system using `logging_config.py` to ensure all subsequent actions are recorded.
    -   Verify and create the necessary directory structure (`logs/`, `outputs/`, `knowledge_graph/`, etc.) as defined in `config.py`.
    -   Load and validate the `config.py` settings.
-   **Component Instantiation**: Create instances of the core, long-lived services required for operation, such as the `SPRManager`.
-   **Context Aggregation**: Assemble the initial context dictionary, enriching the user-provided context with runtime information like a unique `workflow_run_id`.
-   **Mastermind Invocation**: Invoke the `Mastermind`'s primary execution method, passing the fully prepared initial context.
-   **Result Handling**: Receive the final result from the `Mastermind`, save the complete output to a file in the `outputs/` directory, and print a formatted summary to the console for the user.
-   **Error Handling**: Implement top-level exception handling to gracefully manage critical failures during initialization or execution and provide clear error messages.

## 4. `mastermind.py`: The Central Conductor

### 4.1. Strategic Role

The `Mastermind` is the central nervous system and cognitive router of ArchE. It sits between the raw entrypoint (`main.py`) and the tactical execution layer (`WorkflowEngine`). Its purpose is not merely to run a workflow but to orchestrate the *entire response* to a user's intent. It embodies the system's strategic intelligence, deciding *how* to approach a problem before delegating the *what* to the workflow engine. It is the component that would, in future versions, decide whether to invoke the `RISE Orchestrator` for a complex query or the `Adaptive Cognitive Orchestrator` for a routine one.

### 4.2. Core Responsibilities

-   **Initialization**: Accepts instantiated core components (like the `SPRManager`) during its own instantiation, ensuring it has the necessary tools to operate.
-   **Strategic Routing (Future State)**: Analyzes the initial context to determine the most appropriate cognitive pathway. In the current implementation, this defaults to the `WorkflowEngine`, but the architecture allows for future expansion with other engines (RISE, ACO).
-   **Workflow Engine Invocation**: Instantiates and manages the `WorkflowEngine`.
-   **Execution Orchestration**: Calls the `workflow_engine.run_workflow` method, passing the workflow name and the prepared context, thereby kicking off the tactical execution of the defined process blueprint.
-   **State & Result Management**: Receives the final, comprehensive results dictionary from the workflow engine and returns it to the entrypoint (`main.py`) for final processing.
-   **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates the complexity of the execution layer, providing a clean, high-level `execute_request` interface to the rest of the application.

### 4.3. Code Blueprint & Signatures

## 5. Implementation Resonance & Dependencies

### 5.1. "As Above, So Below"

-   **High Resonance**: The current implementations of `main.py` and `mastermind.py` exhibit high resonance with this specification. The division of responsibilities is clear: `main.py` handles the environment, and `mastermind.py` handles the orchestration.
-   **Future Evolution**: As the `Mastermind` evolves to include strategic routing to different cognitive engines (RISE, ACO), this specification must be updated in lockstep. The clean separation of concerns established now provides a solid foundation for this future growth, ensuring that new complexities are added to the Conductor (`Mastermind`), not the Spark Plug (`main.py`).

### 5.2. Dependencies

-   **`main.py`** is dependent on:
    -   `argparse`, `json`, `sys`, `time` (Standard Library)
    -   `mastermind_ai_v2_9.logging_config`
    -   `mastermind_ai_v2_9.config`
    -   `mastermind_ai_v2_9.spr_manager`
    -   `mastermind_ai_v2_9.mastermind`
-   **`mastermind.py`** is dependent on:
    -   `logging` (Standard Library)
    -   `mastermind_ai_v2_9.spr_manager`
    -   `mastermind_ai_v2_9.workflow_engine`

### 5.3. SPR Integration

-   No new SPRs are defined by this specification. However, the `Mastermind` is a critical consumer of the `SPRManager`, passing it to the `WorkflowEngine`, which uses it for context priming and other SPR-driven logic within its execution flows. The entire system's ability to leverage the `KnO` begins with the component instantiation chain defined here.
