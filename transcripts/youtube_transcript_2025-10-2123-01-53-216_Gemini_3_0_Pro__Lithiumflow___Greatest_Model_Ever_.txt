Title: Gemini 3.0 Pro (Lithiumflow): Greatest Model Ever! Most Powerful, Cheapest, & Fastest Model Ever! - YouTube

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Looks like we're back again to discuss a pretty big new update regarding the Gemini 3.0 release. We have two new models currently being tested on LM Marina's WebDev Arena called Lithium Flow and Orion Mist. Both of these models are showing impressive coding capabilities with nearperfect front-end designing skills and even solving complex programming problems with ease. Now, the lithium flow model is a mysterious new AI language model that appeared on Marina, which is a public benchmarking platform for large language models. This was posted on October 19th of this year, and it's widely speculated to be a pre-release version of the Google Gemini 3.0 Pro model, mainly because of Google's internal code naming patterns. For example, Orion directly ties to the past Gemini theory leaks paired with Orion Mist, which is likely Gemini 3.0 Flash. These two represent Google's nextg push towards advanced multimodal AI. Lithium Flow especially excels in UI and graphics generation. It also does quite well with SVG creation and even complex visual renders like a Pelican riding a bicycle or a Nintendo Switch 2 mockup. It also dominates in low latency tasks, making it ideal for realtime app generation and interactive designs. Users on Elmarina have already reported that these two models outperform many of the proprietary models from GBT 5 all the way to many of the other cloud models. Not only in speed, but in quality, especially for creative prompts and front-end builds. But the best part is you don't need to use Google AI studio to get a response from one of the checkpoints. You can simply use Ella Marina where you have a higher success rate of getting a reply directly from Ella Marina's webdev arena. And this is where you can easily access it completely for free and get any ser generations. In this case, I simply sent in a prompt to create a weather forecast with animated UIs. And you can see that it was able to generate it with the lithium flow model which looks absolutely amazing in my opinion. It's really simple to access and it's completely free. You can head over to the LM Arena webdev arena and simply you want to send in any sort of natural language prompt and it it could be something like creating a music playlist generator or something like a smart home dashboard UI. You can send in this prompt and it will take a couple seconds to generate with both of these two models. This is essentially like the checkpoints where you get to compare the responses that is being generated from two different models and you get to judge which model ended up doing better. So it would only reveal it after you provide it which model did a better job. Obviously give the best answer that you think is applicable in that case and it will reveal which model did generate that. And there we go. Just take a look at the code being generated for the smartome dashboard. You can see on the left hand side it looks pretty good in my opinion. It's not bad at all. There is different quick scenes that you can work with. There is the ability to control the room settings for your living room, bedroom, etc. like changing the brightness of the lights maybe or the temperature. You can see which one is on the camera system as well as the energy consumption. Now on the right hand side, overall it looks pretty decent in my opinion in terms of the UI components. You can see that it did a great job in adding all the things that should be needed for any sort of smart home dashboard. There is the energy consumption, the security, all the different rooms for it as well as an energy usage like we saw at the bottom. And as after you have decided on which one looks better, you can simply vote and it will then reveal which one had generated it. So, in this case, it looks like the lithium flow model generated this uh UI for the smart home app. Before we get started, I just want to mention that you should definitely go ahead and subscribe to the world of AI newsletter. I'm constantly posting different newsletters on a weekly basis. So, this is where you can easily get up-to-date knowledge about what is happening in the AI space. So, definitely go ahead and subscribe as this is completely for free. But the thing with the webdev arena is that you have a higher success rate of getting the lithium flow model in comparison to the Google AI studio which is where you're going to get a lot of usage of this potential Google model within the web dev arena. Here is a prompt to make a website presenting yourself which includes things like the company that made you as well as flashy as you would want it to be. Here's a prompt to create a SAS landing page which is representing the company. And the results honestly look pretty impressive for a raw HTML file being generated in WebDev Arena. You're not going to have high context within that web dev arena. But overall, the structure, the animations, even the text hierarchy, it all looked pretty cohesive and deliberate. But here's the thing, the older checkpoints that we saw previously felt a bit more dynamic and expressive. It added animations as well as sound in this case, but it is kind of limiting in terms of the skill set we actually saw previously with the other checkpoints. But then again, I'm seeing landing pages like this being generated by Lithium Flow, which makes me doubt whatever I just had stated as this is just truly remarkable to see such a great generation with animations and such a different type of generation that we've never basically seen with any AI model. Here is where I had requested it to create a beautiful animated SAS landing page. And on the left, we have gotten the generation from the lithium flow model, which looks pretty impressive in my opinion. And the front-end capabilities of this model are just truly insane cuz it looks super intuitive and basically doesn't look AI generated at all. There's the trusted companies, which you can hover over the different animated feature cards, the pricing structure, as well as testimonials. All of this was fully done in a single prompt. And you can see that this is something that looks a lot better than the typical AI generated SAS landing pages. I'm sold. This is the best Mac OS browserbased operating system that I've seen. And I can 100% guarantee that this is by the Lithium Flow model. This looks absolutely amazing. You have functional applications. This definitely looks exactly like a Mac OS operating system. You have the browser which actually showcases Wikipedia. You also have the iMessage. uh app over here, a notes app, which looks exactly like iOS's notes app, the calculator. You also have the terminal, which works. You have a settings tab, and then lastly, trash can. So, let's actually vote. Now, this is what I've gotten with the other model, but we're definitely going to vote that the right one is better. You can see that this was lithium flow, and on the left hand side is GBT 5. This is why everyone's so hyped about this new Gemini 3.0 release cuz it's going to be truly revolutionary in all fronts.
