# Playbook Orchestrator and Federated Agents Integration into RISE

**Date:** 2025-10-27

## Overview

Successfully integrated the PlaybookOrchestrator and federated search agents back into the RISE workflow process. This integration enables dynamic workflow generation and multi-disciplinary search capabilities within the RISE orchestrator.

## Changes Made

### 1. RISE Orchestrator Initialization (`Three_PointO_ArchE/rise_orchestrator.py`)

**Added Initialization:**
- `PlaybookOrchestrator` - For dynamic workflow generation based on query patterns
- Federated Search Agents - For multi-disciplinary search across specialized agents:
  - AcademicKnowledgeAgent
  - CommunityPulseAgent
  - CodebaseTruthAgent
  - VisualSynthesisAgent
  - SearchEngineAgent

**Location:** Lines 239-267

**Code:**
```python
# Initialize Playbook Orchestrator for dynamic workflow generation
try:
    from .playbook_orchestrator import PlaybookOrchestrator
    self.playbook_orchestrator = PlaybookOrchestrator()
    logger.info("ðŸŽ­ PlaybookOrchestrator initialized - dynamic workflow generation enabled")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to initialize PlaybookOrchestrator: {e}")
    self.playbook_orchestrator = None

# Initialize federated agents for multi-disciplinary search
try:
    from .federated_search_agents import (...)
    self.federated_agents = {...}
    logger.info("ðŸ”¬ Federated search agents initialized - multi-disciplinary search enabled")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to initialize federated agents: {e}")
    self.federated_agents = {}
```

### 2. New Methods Added

#### `_generate_dynamic_workflow(problem_description, context)`
- **Purpose:** Generate dynamic workflows using the PlaybookOrchestrator
- **Location:** Lines 907-952
- **Returns:** Path to generated workflow file or None
- **Features:**
  - Analyzes query for ResonantiA patterns
  - Generates custom workflow based on query content
  - Saves workflow to outputs directory
  - Provides graceful error handling

#### `_execute_federated_search(query, agent_types, max_results)`
- **Purpose:** Execute multi-disciplinary search across specialized agents
- **Location:** Lines 954-993
- **Returns:** Dictionary of results from each agent
- **Features:**
  - Executes search across multiple agents in parallel (conceptually)
  - Supports selective agent invocation via agent_types parameter
  - Configurable max_results per agent
  - Provides detailed logging of agent activity

### 3. Integration Points

**Dynamic Workflow Generation:**
- Can be invoked during Phase A initialization
- Automatically detects ResonantiA patterns in queries
- Generates custom workflows tailored to specific query requirements

**Federated Search:**
- Available as a first-class capability in RISE workflows
- Can be invoked during knowledge acquisition phases
- Provides multi-disciplinary perspective on complex queries

## Usage Examples

### Using Dynamic Workflow Generation

```python
# In process_query method
dynamic_workflow_path = self._generate_dynamic_workflow(
    problem_description=query,
    context={"phase": "A", "session_id": self.session_id}
)

if dynamic_workflow_path:
    # Use the dynamic workflow for Phase A
    phase_a_results = self.workflow_engine.run_workflow(
        dynamic_workflow_path,
        initial_context=phase_a_context
    )
```

### Using Federated Search

```python
# During knowledge acquisition
federated_results = self._execute_federated_search(
    query="latest AI developments",
    agent_types=['academic', 'community', 'search'],
    max_results=10
)

# Results are a dictionary organized by agent type:
# {
#   'academic': [...],
#   'community': [...],
#   'search': [...]
# }
```

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic Adaptation:** Workflows can now be generated on-the-fly based on query patterns
2. **Multi-Disciplinary Intelligence:** Federated agents provide diverse perspectives
3. **ResonantiA Integration:** Automatic detection and handling of ResonantiA protocol elements
4. **Flexible Architecture:** Can be enabled/disabled gracefully without breaking existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. Add UI/UX indicators showing which agents are active
2. Implement agent result synthesis and ranking
3. Add caching for dynamic workflows to avoid regeneration
4. Support for custom agent configurations per query type
5. Real-time federated search progress tracking

## Files Modified

- `Three_PointO_ArchE/rise_orchestrator.py` - Added initialization and new methods

## Testing

To test the integration:

```bash
# Run a query that should trigger ResonantiA pattern detection
python ask_arche_vcd_enhanced.py "knowledge scaffolding analysis with ptrf framework"

# The PlaybookOrchestrator should generate a custom workflow
# Federated agents should be used during knowledge acquisition
```

## Notes

- The integration maintains backward compatibility with existing RISE workflows
- Graceful degradation if PlaybookOrchestrator or federated agents fail to initialize
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
