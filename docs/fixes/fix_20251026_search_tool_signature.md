# Fix for Web Search Tool Signature Mismatch

**Date:** 2025-10-26

**Issue:** The `search_web` action was failing with a `TypeError` because the workflow engine was passing a `model` parameter that the function did not accept.

**Root Cause:** A break in Implementation Resonance between the `IARCompliantWorkflowEngine` and the `WebSearchTool`. The workflow engine passes additional context parameters (like `model`) to all actions, but the search tool function only accepted specific named parameters.

**Solution:** Modified the `perform_web_search` function signature in `Three_PointO_ArchE/tools/enhanced_search_tool.py` to accept `**kwargs`. This allows it to gracefully ignore any extra parameters passed by the engine, making the tool more robust and resilient to future changes in the workflow context. The change includes:

1. Added `**kwargs` parameter to the function signature
2. Added logging for extra parameters received (for debugging purposes)
3. Updated the docstring to document the new parameter and its purpose

**Files Modified:**
- `Three_PointO_ArchE/tools/enhanced_search_tool.py` - Modified `perform_web_search` function signature

**Testing:**
- The function now accepts parameters like `model`, `provider`, and other context variables without throwing TypeErrors
- Functionality remains unchanged - extra parameters are simply ignored
- No breaking changes to existing callers

**Impact:**
- Resolves TypeError in Knowledge Scaffolding workflow
- Increases robustness of the web search tool
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Aligns with the principle of graceful degradation
