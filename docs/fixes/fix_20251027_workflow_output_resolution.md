# Fix for Workflow Output Resolution

**Date:** 2025-10-27

**Issue:** Workflow outputs were not being correctly extracted because the `_resolve_value` function was being called with 3 arguments when it only accepts 2. This caused workflows to report that outputs like `specialized_agent` and `session_knowledge_base` were not found, even though the workflow completed successfully.

**Root Cause:** In line 1194-1198 of `Three_PointO_ArchE/workflow_engine.py`, the code was calling:
```python
resolved_out = self._resolve_value(
    out_spec.get('value'),
    runtime_context,
    initial_context  # <-- Extra parameter!
)
```

But the `_resolve_value` method signature is:
```python
def _resolve_value(self, value: Any, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
```

This caused the third parameter to be ignored and the context wasn't properly combined.

**Solution:** Made two fixes to the output resolution:
1. Properly combine the contexts before calling `_resolve_value`:
```python
# Combine contexts: runtime_context takes precedence over initial_context
combined_context = {**initial_context, **runtime_context}
resolved_out = self._resolve_value(
    out_spec.get('value'),
    combined_context
)
```

2. Support both 'output' and 'outputs' keys for backward compatibility:
```python
# Support both 'output' (singular) and 'outputs' (plural) keys for backward compatibility
outputs_def = workflow_definition.get('outputs', workflow_definition.get('output', {}))
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Three_PointO_ArchE/workflow_engine.py` - Fixed workflow output resolution

**Impact:**
- Workflow outputs will now be correctly extracted and available to subsequent phases
- Fixes warnings about "specialized_agent not found in Phase A results"
- Fixes warnings about "session_knowledge_base not found in Phase A results"
- Enables RISE workflow to properly proceed to Phase B with the correct outputs

**Additional Fix:** Added type checking for `final_strategy` in execution history logging to handle both string and dict types gracefully.
