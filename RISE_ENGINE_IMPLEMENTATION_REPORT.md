## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Implementation

### **1. Strategy Fusion Workflow (The "Genius" Core)**

The `strategy_fusion.json` workflow has been completely redesigned to implement the parallel pathway architecture:

```json
{
  "name": "Strategy Fusion Workflow (RISE Phase B)",
  "description": "The 'genius' core of the RISE engine. It analyzes a problem from three parallel perspectives (Causal, Simulative, Comparative) and fuses the resulting insights with the Specialist Agent's report into a single, multi-faceted strategic dossier.",
  "version": "2.0"
}
```

main_action_registry.register_action("perform_abm", perform_abm)
main_action_registry.register_action("run_cfp", run_cfp_action)
