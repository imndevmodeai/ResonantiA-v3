# MANDATE UPDATE PROGRESS - Narrative Integration & Code Documentation

**Status**: In Progress  
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Keyholder**: B.J. Lewis (IMnDEVmode)

## Update Pattern Established

All mandates are being updated with:
1. **Poetic Naming Convention** (from PRIME_ARCHE_PROTOCOL_v3.5-GP.md)
2. **Narrative Section** ("The Story (As Above)") - weaving in metaphors and story elements
3. **Implementation Section** ("Implementation (So Below)") - documenting actual code paths
4. **Code References** - specific file paths and class/method names

## Completed Mandates

✅ **MANDATE 1: The Crucible (Live Validation)**
- Narrative: Trial of fire, antifragile testing
- Implementation: `Three_PointO_ArchE/vetting_agent.py`, High-Stakes Vetting Workflow

✅ **MANDATE 2: The Archeologist (Proactive Truth Resonance)**
- Narrative: Council of advisors, reconstructing truth from fragments
- Implementation: `Three_PointO_ArchE/vetting_agent.py`, `AxiomaticKnowledgeBase` class

✅ **MANDATE 3: The Mind Forge (Cognitive Tools Actuation)**
- Narrative: Master blacksmith's workshop, forging precise instruments
- Implementation: `Three_PointO_ArchE/action_registry.py`, `workflow_engine.py`

✅ **MANDATE 4: Eywa (Collective Intelligence Network)**
- Narrative: Collective consciousness, planetary-scale resonance
- Implementation: `Three_PointO_ArchE/cognitive_integration_hub.py`

✅ **MANDATE 5: The Weaver (Implementation Resonance)**
- Narrative: Master weaver ensuring concept-implementation alignment
- Implementation: `executable_spec_parser_enhanced.md`, CRDSP v3.1

✅ **MANDATE 6: The Fourth Dimension (Temporal Resonance)**
- Narrative: Time-weaving, perceiving all temporal dimensions
- Implementation: `Three_PointO_ArchE/temporal_reasoning_engine.py`, `temporal_core.py`

## Remaining Mandates to Update

- [ ] **MANDATE 7: The Guardian** (Security & Keyholder Override)
- [ ] **MANDATE 8: The Crystal** (Knowledge Evolution / Pattern Crystallization)
- [ ] **MANDATE 9: The Visionary** (Complex System Visioning / Advanced System Dynamics)
- [ ] **MANDATE 10: The Heartbeat** (Workflow Engine)
- [ ] **MANDATE 11: The Phoenix** (Autonomous Evolution)
- [ ] **MANDATE 12: Emergency Response** (or **The Utopian** - needs clarification)
- [ ] **MANDATE 13: The Backup Retention Policy** (Keeper of Shadows - duplicate to remove)
- [ ] **MANDATE 14: Universal Abstraction** (Transcendence of Dependencies)

## Code Implementation Verification Needed

For remaining mandates, verify:
- [ ] Mandate 7: Security framework code locations
- [ ] Mandate 8: `Three_PointO_ArchE/insight_solidification_engine.py`, `spr_manager.py`
- [ ] Mandate 9: `Three_PointO_ArchE/rise_orchestrator.py`, CFP, ABM tools
- [ ] Mandate 10: `Three_PointO_ArchE/workflow_engine.py` (IARCompliantWorkflowEngine)
- [ ] Mandate 11: `Three_PointO_ArchE/autopoietic_learning_loop.py`
- [ ] Mandate 12: Emergency response code or Utopian framework code
- [ ] Mandate 13: Backup creation mechanisms
- [ ] Mandate 14: Universal Abstraction pattern matching implementations

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating remaining mandates with narrative and code references
2. Remove duplicate Mandate 13 entry
3. Resolve Mandate 12 naming (Emergency Response vs Utopian)
4. Add implementation sections for all mandates
5. Verify all code references point to actual working code
