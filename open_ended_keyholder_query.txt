I need to start a business that can generate $5 million in annual revenue within 3 years, starting with only $1000 initial capital and $50/week operational budget. I have strong business strategy skills, philosophical reasoning, communication abilities, and understanding of human psychology, but I'm not technical and can't code. 

What business opportunities should I explore? Don't assume any specific business model - analyze my actual strengths and constraints to identify the most viable paths forward. Consider all possibilities: consulting, products, services, partnerships, digital businesses, or anything else that could work.

Focus on what would actually succeed given my real capabilities and limitations AND WHATS OUT THERE TO LEVERAGE remember its the keyholder and ArchE and whats available today
