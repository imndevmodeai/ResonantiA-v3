Evaluate the potential cascading effects of implementing a global AI governance framework (2026-2035) that mandates algorithmic transparency, data sovereignty requirements, and cross-border AI development restrictions. Consider how this framework might interact with: (1) emerging quantum encryption technologies that could enable privacy-preserving AI training, (2) geopolitical tensions between AI-superpower nations creating fragmented AI ecosystems, (3) the rapid evolution of neuromorphic computing architectures challenging traditional AI paradigms, (4) economic disruptions from AI-driven automation creating social instability, and (5) the emergence of autonomous AI research systems that could accelerate development beyond human control. Model the temporal dynamics of these interactions, predict multiple scenario outcomes across different time horizons (near-term 2026-2029, mid-term 2029-2032, long-term 2032-2035), identify critical decision points where policy interventions could alter trajectories, and assess the systemic risks of both implementing and not implementing such a framework.
