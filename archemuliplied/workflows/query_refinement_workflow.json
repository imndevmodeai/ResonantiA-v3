Rigorously identify the items listed in point 3 from the User Query.\n2.  Based on your deconstruction, rephrase the user's core objective into a precise and actionable statement.\n3.  Structure your output as a JSON object with two main keys: \"deconstructed_elements\" and \"rephrased_objective\".\n    The \"deconstructed_elements\" object should contain keys for: \"core_concepts\" (list of strings), \"entities\" (list of strings), \"temporal_scope\" (string), \"key_metrics\" (list of strings), \"assumptions\" (list of strings), \"ambiguities\" (list of strings), and \"human_factor_relevance\" (string or list of strings).\n    The \"rephrased_objective\" should be a string.\n\nExample of the JSON structure for your output (do not include this example wrapper in your actual output, only the JSON itself):\nExample Output JSON:\n{{\n  \"deconstructed_elements\": {{\n    \"core_concepts\": [\"Universal Basic Income\", \"Economic Impact\", \"Social Consequences\"],\n    \"entities\": [\"UBI Policy Z\", \"Region Alpha\"],\n    \"temporal_scope\": \"5-year projection\",\n    \"key_metrics\": [\"poverty rate\", \"inflation\", \"labor participation\"],\n    \"assumptions\": [\"Demographic trends remain constant\"],\n    \"ambiguities\": [\"Specific details of UBI Policy Z are not provided\"],\n    \"human_factor_relevance\": [\"Impact on work motivation\", \"Changes in consumption patterns\"]\n  }},\n  \"rephrased_objective\": \"Assess the 5-year economic and social impact of UBI Policy Z in Region Alpha, focusing on poverty, inflation, and labor, assuming constant demographics and noting unspecified policy details and human motivational factors.\"\n}}\nEnd of Example Output JSON.\n\nEnsure your final output is ONLY the JSON object as described.",
