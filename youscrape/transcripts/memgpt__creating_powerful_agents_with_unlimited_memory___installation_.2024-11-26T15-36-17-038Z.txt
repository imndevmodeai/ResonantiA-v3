0:00 remember mgpt it's a framework that
0:03 allows you to build large Lage model
0:04 agents that are infused with memory and
0:07 this is with addition with custom tools
0:10 it enables anyone to build and deploy
0:13 stateful large L model agents with
0:15 long-term memory which is able to
0:17 connect to external data sources like
0:19 PDF files for rag you have the ability
0:22 to Define and call Custom tools like
0:24 Google search and you have the ability
0:26 to also integrate other plugins now back
0:29 when we had covered it on the channel it
0:31 wasn't Deployable with a UI that you see
0:34 over here it didn't have any of the mgpt
0:37 services that they've just recently
0:38 introduced and this is why we're
0:40 actually going to be covering it once
0:41 again due to its extensive new tool set
0:44 and abilities so with that thought guys
0:46 stay tuned and let's get straight into
0:47 the video and showcase this new UI as
0:50 well as the M GPT Services which they
0:52 have introduced sorry for being
0:55 repetitive but this month we had insane
0:57 Partnerships with big companies giving
0:59 us subscriptions to AI tools completely
1:02 for free these are tools that will
1:04 streamline your business's growth and
1:06 improve your efficiency just being a
1:09 patreon this past month you were given
1:11 access to six paid subscriptions
1:13 completely for free not only do you
1:15 access these subcriptions but you gain
1:17 the ability for Consulting networking
1:20 collaborating with the community as well
1:22 as with myself you get access to daily
1:25 AI news resources giveaways and so much
1:28 more if you're interested check out out
1:30 the patreon link in the description
1:31 below to gain access to these
1:36 benefits hey what is up guys welcome
1:38 back to another YouTube video at the
1:40 world of AI in today's video we're going
1:42 to be taking a look at M GPT now if you
1:45 haven't seen this video you should
1:46 definitely do so this is a video I made
1:49 on mgpt long time ago around 6 months
1:51 ago and we went over this framework but
1:54 just to briefly go over what mgpt is
1:57 it's basically this framework that's
1:58 designed to simplify by the development
2:00 and the deployment of stateful large
2:02 nage model agents it offers various
2:05 functionalities like long-term memory
2:08 and State Management where it's going to
2:10 be able to allow the creation of agents
2:12 that can retain and access information
2:15 over extended periods this will reduce
2:18 the costage of having different large
2:21 Lage models utilize less tokens as it
2:23 refers to previous context and this will
2:26 enhance your contextual understanding
2:28 better now it ALS Al allows you for
2:31 having con connections with external
2:33 data sources now which is with Rag and
2:36 it will enable a large language model
2:38 agent to connect to external data
2:39 sources which will facilitate tasks such
2:42 as document analysis and this is through
2:44 rag setups you're now also able to
2:47 Define and call Custom Tool functions
2:49 where you're going to be able to Define
2:51 and utilize custom functions such as
2:53 integrating Google search for example so
2:55 that you can extend the capabilities of
2:57 your large language model agent this is
3:00 a great framework that we have covered
3:02 previously and we finally got a new
3:04 update where mgbt supports the
3:06 deployment of multi- agents and
3:08 multi-user services that M GPZ Services
3:11 provide and it's going to be making it
3:13 more suitable for various applications
3:16 it's completely open source and it's
3:18 something that I'm going to be
3:18 showcasing how to install this UI cuz it
3:21 is definitely way more easier to use and
3:24 it's super easy to use their tool
3:26 Builder we can see that this is the mgbt
3:28 dev portal we're going to be able to
3:29 create Monitor and chat with your large
3:32 language model agents now guys there's
3:34 actually multiple methods to get started
3:36 with mgpt but say you want to install
3:39 mgpt with the def portal we're going to
3:42 be utilizing Docker to set this up but
3:44 there's also a way to start it up with
3:46 your Clive which is possibly something
3:49 that many of us who do not have the
3:50 hardware requirements should follow
3:52 through with you can get started by
3:54 going to the docs simply copying this
3:56 command pip install pi mgbt if you
4:00 already have mgpt like say if you watch
4:02 this video and you already had it
4:03 installed previously you can just simply
4:06 update it by putting in the dash update
4:08 command beside the PIP install pipe mgpt
4:12 and once you have installed mgpt on your
4:14 command prompt or your computer you can
4:16 then get started by running mgpt with
4:18 this command and you'll be able to start
4:19 chatting with it within vs code or your
4:22 cly but now what we're going to be doing
4:24 is installing mgbt with a server so that
4:28 we can access this UI so first things
4:30 first you need to make sure that you
4:32 have the requirements fulfilled you need
4:33 to make sure that you have Docker
4:35 installed if you do not make sure you
4:37 install it for your operating system
4:39 whether that's Mac windows or Linux now
4:42 this would require at least 8 GB of vram
4:45 so make sure you have that fulfilled
4:47 beforehand so that you know that you you
4:50 don't waste time basically if you do not
4:52 have the hardware compatibility now once
4:55 you have Docker installed what you can
4:57 do is go back to the mgpt uh get
4:59 repository you want to basically click
5:01 on this green button over here and copy
5:03 the geub repository link once you have
5:05 done that scroll back down to the
5:08 section which is Dev portal and just to
5:10 note that this is actually an alpha
5:12 build so it's going to be current
5:14 continuously upgraded over a period of
5:17 time they're going to be adding more
5:18 updates and they're going to be trying
5:20 their best to keep evolving and
5:22 innovating this platform further so what
5:24 you want to do now is after you have
5:26 Docker installed and you copied this
5:28 link you need to also make sure that you
5:30 have G installed and once all of that
5:32 has been fulfilled you can open up your
5:34 command prompt and you can just simply
5:36 type in get clone and copy the link or
5:39 paste the link into your command prompt
5:40 and click enter this will take a couple
5:42 of seconds to clone the repository and
5:45 once this is done what we can do is we
5:48 can then go into the CD or sorry the
5:51 mgbt file which we just cloned and this
5:54 is by typing in CD mgbt once we are in
5:57 the mgbt directory we we can run Docker
6:00 compose up and it's easy as that guys
6:03 now I totally forgot to do this what you
6:05 got to do is go into your VSS code or
6:08 your ID and what you want to do is open
6:10 up your n file in the mgpt folder what
6:14 you want to do is just rename this so
6:16 what we're going to do is find the
6:18 rename function take out. example and
6:22 what we're going to do is set the
6:23 variables so you can actually set a
6:24 password so when you have opened up your
6:27 mgpt on your Local Host post you can
6:30 then access it through a password so
6:32 definitely set it beforehand I'm just
6:34 going to keep it the default password
6:36 which is just password and I'm going to
6:38 set my open AI API key once I've done
6:41 this you can then go back into Docker
6:43 you can simply just paste this up and
6:45 you can click enter and your Docker will
6:47 start running sorry about that I should
6:49 have mentioned it before but once this
6:51 has finished starting up we're going to
6:53 be able to open it up on our local or
6:55 sorry the mgbt localhost in our browser
6:59 so once this is finished composing the
7:01 docker I'm going to be right back and
7:03 we're going to be starting to play
7:05 around with it so it looks like it's
7:07 running now so what we can do is go back
7:09 to our GitHub repository copy this link
7:12 and we can open up a new tab and head
7:14 over to our mgpt uh UI and we can see
7:19 that we're going to be now able to work
7:21 with M gpt's framework where we're going
7:23 to be able to create a long-term memory
7:25 agent that have the ability to connect
7:28 to external data sources and we're going
7:30 to have the ability to Define and call
7:32 Custom functions this is where we're
7:34 going to be playing around and creating
7:35 creating our AI agents so what you want
7:38 to do first is go to the setting you can
7:40 configure certain things over here where
7:43 you're going to be able to add a URL
7:45 you're going to be able to create your
7:46 own profile so that you can have
7:48 multiple people working in this UI now
7:51 your agents tab is where you're going to
7:53 be working with your agents where you're
7:55 going to be able to create multiple
7:56 agents your data sources is where you're
7:58 going to be able to upload various file
8:00 types such as Excel files notion files
8:04 you have various components that you can
8:05 integrate within mgbt you have a tool
8:08 Builder that you can basically work with
8:10 where you can see that there's example
8:12 tools already here where there's a send
8:15 tool and this is where it's going to be
8:17 able to send messages to a human you can
8:19 see that there's various other tools
8:21 that they have already pre-built you
8:23 have Persona template where they're
8:25 going to be able to reenact a certain
8:27 type of persona you have user templates
8:30 for whoever is utilizing mgpt on this
8:33 local server so what we're going to be
8:35 doing first is just creating our own
8:36 agent we can name this world of AI agent
8:40 we can util utilize uh various models at
8:44 the current moment we only have it
8:45 preset to GPT 4 but say if we want to
8:49 utilize something else you can go to the
8:51 GitHub repository and they basically St
8:53 that you have the ability to support
8:55 different end points and backends you
8:57 can see that there's LM end points for
8:59 Aur open AI Google AI Gemini model
9:02 anthropic and so many others you can
9:05 have it connected to hugging or sorry
9:07 Lama CPP you have UGA web UI and you're
9:11 going to be able to have embedding end
9:12 points for open Ai and Aur AI or aour
9:16 open Ai and hugging face Dei but in this
9:19 case we're just going to be utilizing
9:20 gbt 4 cuz it should be able to do most
9:23 of the things for us so we're going to
9:25 set the model to gbt 4 we can select the
9:27 Persona you can see that there's already
9:29 base personas made so if we are to
9:32 actually go back we're just going to
9:33 copy this so we don't waste time but we
9:35 can go to the Persona template you can
9:37 see that these are the following
9:39 personas that have been already created
9:41 so I have went along and created my own
9:43 Persona so what I'm going to do is go
9:44 back to the agent tab create my agent
9:47 base my agent name and then I'm going to
9:49 select my Persona so I have the world of
9:51 AI Persona and this is basically a
9:53 personal that states that you are a
9:55 famous AI YouTuber I'm just boosting
9:57 myself here but you will answer
9:59 questions about Ai and showcase what you
10:01 can do with it now what you can do is
10:02 you can select the user you can just
10:04 select the basic user you can then go
10:07 move forward I mean move down sorry and
10:09 then you can select various tools that
10:11 you can actually create beforehand you
10:13 can see that you can add in an archival
10:16 memory where you're going to be able to
10:17 make sure that the phrase the memory
10:19 contents such as that it'll be easily
10:21 queried later you also have conversation
10:24 search tools and various other tools
10:26 that you can get started and turn on if
10:28 you want so once that is done you can
10:30 just create the agent and then you can
10:32 head over to the agents Tab and you can
10:34 just simply click on the conversation
10:36 icon over here you can then start
10:38 chatting with your agent so you can see
10:40 that a prompt template you can add
10:42 afterwards it's going to be coming soon
10:44 but you can also add core memory you can
10:46 configure that you can add data sources
10:49 you have tools as well as different chat
10:51 settings that you can work with and in
10:52 here you're going to be able to utilize
10:54 the M jpt framework with this UI so that
10:56 you can chat and create your own AI
10:58 agent with M gpt's framework as the back
11:02 end which will provide you the long-term
11:04 memory and it will be able to enhance
11:07 your contextual understanding as in your
11:10 ai's understanding so that it's going to
11:11 be able to provide and retain and access
11:14 information way better than any regular
11:16 AI agent and that's basically it for
11:18 today's video on mgbt I really wanted to
11:21 Showcase this new UI as well as this new
11:23 upgrade where you're going to be able to
11:25 integrate mgpt Services where you're
11:27 going to be able to integrate various
11:28 tools
11:29 where you can make your AI agent Smarter
11:32 with better memory and that's about it
