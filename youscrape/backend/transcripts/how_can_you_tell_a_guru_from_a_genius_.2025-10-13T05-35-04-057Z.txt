he founded a company called Great Western resources which was an oil exploration company it sold for $450 million 10 years later his next big great Venture is hosting masterminds to insecure dudes that want to be less insecure for $30,000 he's made $ 36 million selling these masterminds what he's known for buying a castle in Scotland for $650,000 supposedly that castle is worth 32 million today they use their own AI voice agent to raise $8 million without ever speaking to an actual investor [Music] themselves for those that listened last week we talked about a guy named Frank Kar that was a somewhat controversial internet marketer the guy who taught Cardone and Tony Robbins how to be Cardone Grant Cardone and Tony Robbins I got another guy for you today Nick and you know who he is and you love this guy you ready okay yes yes yes yes yes yes I love gurus dude you're a goober guy okay you ready yes Dan pea tell me what you know about this guy oh my gosh because I went deep okay it's been a while since I've done research on Dan Pia but if you've ever seen any of these Instagram videos of the guys who are like pumping up the sales guys you know there's like a trend right now where they want the hardcore guys Andy Elliot's like this you gonna have sixpack to work for me bro right take your Shir off de Pe√±a is he's 70 years old hard a lives in Florida and is just always spitting the most dramatic 80 years old believe it or not is he born in 45 it's very much like just freaking do it what does it matter you're lying ah he wants there's a quote of him on video he's like listen this whole Bitcoin thing I know who Satoshi is I can't tell you but when it's gonna when it comes out there's going to be a lot of instability I know I know personally who he is like oh my gosh these guys anyways that's Dan pinion I'm glad you said that because I'm going to switch up the order of what I was going to talk about and I'm going to talk about Dan P's predictions of the future hosted on his own website dana. co.uk you ready for this still still someone needs to update the website if you're listening to me please go update the website Dan told us that Trump would win in a landslide Victory this year okay okay okay okay okay Dan also told us so no one listened says Dan told you so no one listened there's a YouTube video to click on and the YouTube video has been removed okay not sure what that one was bad link happens Dan predicted that Rick Scott would be our next US president so Still Holding Out for that one no this was years ago still holding out hey it could still happen hey he's he's one for two he's batting 500 that's a good that's a great batting average that's okay Dan predicted that cyber security would be a hot deal that's bold that's a hot deal what you don't know what a hot deal is it's gonna be a hot deal yeah yep that's the be that's the best prediction you could make because it just it cover it's so broad all so hey he's two for three though I mean it's a hot deal he's got 666 he predicted that Iran and Syria would be flattened by the US okay I mean Syria's flattened wasn't flattened by the us but okay hey it's geopolitical United States he can't be an expert in everything and he predicted that the greatest Mexican drug cartel boss of all time El Chapo Guzman would pay for the border wall and he obviously did right in his defense he did he cut a check I'm pretty sure he I I might have been all cash I can't remember exactly how he paid for it huh so that's Dan's predictions but we're getting ahead of ourselves so I'm going to give little background on Dan okay you ready mhm born in Jacksonville Florida 1945 he threatened to kill his teacher by dropping a glass aquarium on them and he talks about this in all his Mastermind seminars you know why do you know why I don't know because he was abused by him but wait there's more not physically abused but he put a Dun on him and made him sit in the corner makes sense MH okay so he threat crime he literally went on a balcony over his head and tried to drop an aquarium on his head and now he about stable genius he's not even telling that story as like that I'm reformed no he brags about it it's it's it's literally a negotiating tactic right it's like then anybody who negotiates with him like Let Go freaking drop an aquarium on my head yep so as I tell you these stories I want you to start thinking of some Frameworks of Dan Pena that we can apply for the betterment of ourselves and Society okay okay again you and I never talk about this stuff I have a story for you after this oh that we did not plan for okay and I've got a about wait there's more so how's that for a rehook okay okay so he founded a company called Great Western resources which was an oil exploration company in 1982 supposedly now they're very few details or quote proof that he actually did these things but we do know that this was a real company as far as what his ownership was in it or if he founded it or not no one really knows it's sold for 450 million uh 10 years later wow yeah 1986 $450 million that's a lot of money in 1986 92 he founded in 82 sold it in 92 oh okay but he was also ousted from that company details are blurry maybe 91 maybe 93 we don't know but it was listed this company was listed on the London Stock Exchange that is provable we just don't know what his ownership was in it other than what he told us okay this was given at a seminar one of his many Mastermind seminars that cost $30,000 to attend my favorite quote is if I leave here with anyone liking me I have failed okay can you dive in on that for me oh my gosh it's a reverse psychology sales tactic right like you're you're anchoring people in the very beginning and you're getting them to buy into the Kool-Aid like oh yeah I'm this going to be freaking hardcore yeah I'm going to hate him by the end of this it's it's very good framing for the kind of seminar that he's going to put on right like yeah he's establishing himself as the authority I'm the authority you're going to hate me so much by the end of this because I'm gonna freaking whip you into shape right and the people who are on the receiving in they're like yeah this is GNA be so good for me oh my gosh this is this is this is fantastic like they're just in this reciprocal feedback loop that he's setting up so anyways yeah nut case keep going so he's ,000 $30,000 he is known for buying a castle in Scotland at age 39 for $650,000 do you know what that is worth today or not what the castle is worth but after inflation 650 I'm gonna guess 1.5 extremely close 1.4 in change okay wow okay so supposedly that castle is worth 32 million today but I just think it's funny because he this is like his claim to fame is that he bought a castle and that's like that's like buying like a a three-bedroom house in Palo Alto today like at that price right that's bloody great that's a great deal in a castle he renovated the castle and that's where he holds his masterminds which he has been holding for 30 years now so after he makes a half a billion dollars he makes yeah it is that is Gen after he makes half a billion dollars with a bee supposedly according to him his next big great Venture is hosting masterminds to insecure dudes that want to be less insecure for $30,000 he's made $36 million selling these masterminds what how do you know that is quite provable because he has two or three a year he has 20 to 25 people per and they're $30,000 each so assuming they're all sold out and he's had that many per year for 30 years 36 million but don't you want to know what framework he teaches at this Mastermind Nick I would love to yes what what does he teach these people I'm in the business of saving all of our listeners $30,000 so you're about to get $30,000 worth of value from the million doll man himself and I'll get into that nickname in a minute and it's the QA principle and it's these are actually Nick and I'll Ser these are mindblowing principles that you've never heard or thought of before so are you ready for these I'm yes number one you ready reshape your mindset okay it's a good place to start your success it starts between your ears I'm GNA like sit for 10 minutes and let you think about that before I go to number two because your brain's between your ears very good wow you got that quick number two set big audacious goals Wow have you ever thought of that oh no like I usually think to set really small goals you know in his defense that's actually that that's a pretty good that's a pretty good thing to teach keep going it's good number three build a Dream Team hire smart people I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that before number four identify and acquire businesses we're just like getting straight there we go we go like be smart make good decisions go acquire businesses wait wait what how'd you get there I think you skipped a few things no no it's like it's like all right I have no money but I financed everything to come to this Mastermind $30,000 oh I'm gonna get to the no money thing don't worry what's step one step one gotta get that grind set did to do can do I got that got that grind set step two uhuh set big goals easy I'm gonna be a billionaire okay okay all right all right what's next what do I need to do next step three assemble a team step four identify and buy businesses I okay I can't even pull forward to pay for the team how how am I identifying and buying these businesses exact step five cash out refi start a course sell it to millions of people but wait Nick he does get more specific he especially encourages firsttime entrepreneurs to acquire businesses okay and they should be distressed ideally and underperforming no way this is really this is swe I swear yes okay okay number five okay you're going to finance this business with no money down how seller financing obviously and government grants clearly number six number six you're gonna grow the business you're just going to grow it you're gonna say grow and it's just going to do it okay that's how it works number seven you're going to create a money machine I don't know why that wasn't step one honestly if that was step one it could have saved us all a lot is it a 3D printer is it like what the M machine is yep step eight of eight repeat and scale that's it oh $30,000 in three what would he do what would he do if you're coming to him you're like I want to join your course but I can't afford it and he's like it's $30,000 you got to figure out how to freaking make this money okay okay okay what if I sell or Finance it Dan there you go will you hold the note step four will you hold the note are you going to sell her Finance it or what no no no no that's not what this means that's not what this means but you're saying it's a $30,000 investment in my future right like it's going to set me up for Success absolutely perfect seller finance it Dan do you know why he refers to himself as the trillion dollar man I don't know because people that have been through his course have created a trillion dollars worth of value before or after they went through the course before or after either one either one imagine how much value JK Rowling created by selling hundreds of millions of copies of Harry Potter think about it think about all the money that those readers made wait did JK Rin go through it no I'm just saying like that framework of like if you made money if you shook my hand once and then you made a million dollars I created a million dollars worth of value is there anybody out there who's like admitted to going through Dan peno's Mastermind yeah there are several YouTube videos of guys that went through it and make fun of the entire thing it's quite hilarious really in fact one guy started convulsing and urinated on himself and threw up on himself during the seminar and Dan Pena made fun of him the whole time as it was happening from the stage so that's pretty funny yep I mean in Dan's defense what's he supposed to do call call a medic I don't know so what good can we take from these principles in all seriousness what is there to learn from like why is he successful Nick well before we get into that I have a story for you okay so I sold a business a few years ago and the people that were really interested in this business were private Equity people I got a lot of inquiries a lot of people reaching out right it was a good business we had grown it it was profitable it was great we were exiting one of the groups that reached out was Dan pus group and so they I think I remember this yeah before the call I get it wasn't even a Sim right because like the Sim is what the seller would send them explain what a Sim is so a Sim cim conf confidential information memorandum usually it's what sellers provide to prospective buyers to tell them about their business this how long the business has been around here the key customers this is how much money we make these are the contract like just everything about your business that a buyer would want to know initially and then you hop on a call and you kind of dive into more well they sent me like a SIM for their investment team and front and center on their investment team was Dan Pe√±a right so this is like Dan Pena's fund and I looking back I'm like I don't know if they were just if he was just being used as like hey this media person he might not have had anything to do with it well I think he had something to do with it but I don't know if it was his money or if it was like I'll lend you my likeness and you can leverage that right anyways so I get that and I'm like I was going to not take the meeting anyways but I'm like Dan pen is involved I gotta take that meeting bro and this is after you had been down like the the Instagram reals Dan p√± your rabbit hole and we've been sending him back and forth yeah I I was calling you I called you about this cuz I was so excited I'm like Dam so I take the meeting with their team Dan Dan wasn't on probably be better if I was like Dan p√± was on but he wasn't on I want you to guess how the negotiations went it was a joke I don't know they went exactly like you would think a Dan p√± negotiation would go hey tell us about your business well we're doing about $6 million in Top Line 1.5 million in bottom line Market com are three three or five times so we're looking between five and eight million do in of a of a purchase price you're not going to get that like initially out of the gate you're not GNA get that like what yeah you're not gonna get Market's not going to pay that here's what we're willing to offer a million dollars financed over X period of time and seriously and you stay on but you can earn an additional $5 million if you grow this business to $100 million business and with Dan's brand and with our backing and I was like is this for real is this like just like that I said it on the call like is this is this for real they're like are you kidding me have you seen what Dan's done it like and that that's that's how this conversation it was the weirdest conversation they thought they could just come in bull in a china shop and I'm sure that they do buy businesses like that I'm sure there are some idiots out there who are like okay yeah I guess I'll sell but I was like yeah it went exactly like I would have thought a Dan payel Leed negotiation strategy would have gone it was so dumb and tell us what that ended up selling for well I can't tell you the exact number but it sold for the range that that I named in the in the beginning and it didn't take all that long no it sold really it was a great business it sold really quick yeah so some of these some of these guys are like it's just a spray and prey kind of tactic what can we take from dampa I mean I think there's a couple things I think the reason I'm so obsessed with gurus is because I'm infatuated by this level of confidence that is irrational because I don't have it I just don't have it you have a lot more confidence than me but but you know but you are nowhere near that level right it's these guys who have like this God level complex and they are so confident that reasonable people like us look at them and say what he's saying sounds unbelievable but he's so confident he surely can't be lying about it right it's not a lie if you believe it and in many George cza said in many instances though that fundamental belief and drive has created value for them like a perfect example of this Jesse Tinsley he texted me like two weeks ago I'm going to buy Tik Tok H and I'm like you just bought bench Tik tok's like a 20 billion dollar company and then through his like he just wills it into existence somehow he gets a meeting with Mr Beast he's convinced Mr Beast to help him buy like he's literally in talks I mean I haven't seen the talks but supposedly he's in talks with the US government about buying Tik Tok because he just spoke it into existence so I am infatuated by these people who have an unshakable belief themselves many of these gurus use it for evil right because they're just like trying to extract as much value out of people but it's also a very strong trait in some of the best Founders and entrepreneurs Steve Jobs Mark Zuckerberg Elon Musk like these guys that have just gone on to do great things this like self-belief that is unshakable and you know what like you only have to be right once like you could make these bold audacious claims and be wrong every time and then once you're right that really has carries more weight than any of the wrong predictions that you had in your what or what you were building like Elon Musk he went and he just said all right I sold this company I'm going to buy a castle in Scotland like there's tangible proof that he can point to to say like yeah I'm successful I got I got a castle so anyways I I think the unshakable belief is is something I admire and I'm both terrified of at the same time it's true in some of these people it's like the the firefest guy yeah dude that's a perfect example because so many of us fake it till we make it we're like no I'm G do it I'm Adam Newman we work like Adam Newman made out like band until the day he dies he could raise as much money as he'd ever want despite his history because of that unshakable confidence Elon Musk like you've read his biography how many times did he promised a rocket was going to take off or that we Canna have full self-driving or we're gonna have robots on like whatever it is he's promised all of these things and while he may not have hit every single timeline look at what he's accomplished like he's still able to point to some of these things so again it's it's a trait it's a trait that I both fear him in admiration of you know what the big difference is because like Alex brosi makes a lot if not most of his money from conferences a lot of people don't know that okay the so like they're both making millions of dollars doing the same thing but what makes one of them I don't want to call him a fraud because I don't want to get sued but he has a poor reputation and the other one Alex Heros arguably has a great reputation despite the fact that he's making millions of dollars selling courses and masterminds and high ticket XY in my opinion it's because one of them is very specific Alex horos he's written books his books are extremely tactical you're G to go to meta ads manager you're going to click on this you're going to use Advantage plus you're going to use broad targeting don't tell meta what your audience is and like it's very specific granular because he's sat down at a desk for 18 hours straight and done all these things right whereas yeah the other guy is just talking like platitudes that are super Broad high level yeah it's the difference between the steak and the sizzle right like or the you know the bark and the bite MH they both are salesmen they both talk a big game they both are like I can change your life blah blah blah but I think one of them delivers more tangibly for the target audience that they have so video is cool but you know what's better long form audio via podcast and my newsletter TKO pod.com go there to subscribe for free to my newsletter it's one email a week very tactical and then go to my audio podcast three episodes a week stuff like this you're going to love it all free no sleazy sales TKO pod.com a lot of those sales gurus strike me as very motivational hey this is the kick in the pants that you need hey oh just do it just freaking grow up and do it you're being a little baby and that's needed for many people but bro mosy is very tactical it's like yes you're going to get the motivational thing but if you go and you pay for his course or you go and you buy his book it's also like oh that's a really good strategy oh holy crap like that you can scale a business this way so like I agree with you it's it's in the product offering itself and I think that that goes for any entrepreneur you've got to be good at sales but You' got to make sure that what you're selling is actually backed up by a good product otherwise you're going to get the first couple sales and then you're constantly going to need to be churning through people like there there's a reason that Dan Pena puts out content that is divisive or controversial it's because he needs his name out there enough in order for people to keep coming to his courses whereas Alex isn't necessarily putting out the controversial stuff The Word of Mouth from people who have gone to his conferences or the Word of Mouth from people who are sharing his posts because of the Goodwill is really doing the work the leg work for him and that like that's the type of business that you want as an entrepreneur you want the Goodwill to be doing the leg work you don't want to just be Nick Huber is an example like I worry about following down sort of this pan path right it's like well I got views I got clicks but is that the best way it is for him right now yeah you ready for the grand finale of this segment for on yeah so during this deep dive I learned that Dan P will basically go on any podcast that ask him and so I emailed his publicist and invited him on the holdco Bros podcast segment and I'm so excited I don't have a yes yet but I'm confident I can get a yes and we will have him on here and ask him all kinds of hairy questions at least you will because you like the awkward stuff and I don't look if he's generous enough to come on and give us his time I'm not going to be rude to him no not rude I'm just talking about like hard-hitting questions yeah no yeah yeah I will I will ask him things and he'll probably I don't know a lot of those guys like Donald Trump's like this he can take a good ribbing like he's very conversational but if he feels like you're attacking him and adversarial that's when he's going to start just like hitting back on things right so yeah I would be curious to see what he's what like Dan is like in a conversational setting well I think one of the questions needs to be listen and you can use the Trump tactic a lot of people are saying and they are on the internet a lot of people are saying that you don't have 500 million that you never sold this that you didn't have much ownership in this business at all in fact where you made most of your money is the $3.3 million lawsuit settlement you got for wrongful termination a lot of people say that do you have any hard proof a document any sort of evidence because this was pre- internet that you actually made all this money to prove the haters wrong and he's probably say I don't care about the haters probably going like talk around it I'd be very curious to hear his answer to that the second question is if you're so successful in business why do you make all of your money selling courses why aren't you starting other businesses see what he says there I probably wouldn't ask him those direct questions I guess I'll have to do it would you you can do it I would ask him things like because it's so foreign to me how do you reconcile like not having the things that you say you're having while you're doing it even though you've eventually achieved it right it's like it's the fake it till you make it on steroids where you're projecting this Ultra successful person but if somebody came in and actually audited you they would look at it sit down and look at it and be like it's actually not true however you needed that level of confidence like how did how did you I don't know I think he I know I'm not sure he's been divorced I think he might be he's been married the whole time to the same woman right right right like I would ask him I'd be like does your wife look at you and like damn that's not true or like how does that conversation go like that's I would be very curious about that particular piece of it because I could never do that I would I would never be able to live with myself but I'm sure he's got his like his way of convincing himself that it's fine so anyways and we're gonna have to pay a lot of money to Muhammad to edit that episode because he can be he can be a little Brash that's gonna be so funny all right all right AI ID of the week I was listening to your conversation with James camp where you guys were talking about Ai and I really enjoyed it I thought it was like an awesome conversation but one of the things that popped into my mind as I was listening to it was if AI is going to make it so much easier for us to do outbound to like reach out to people and have agents that are having conversations it's probably going to be a hellscape for you the consumer in the future you're just constantly going to be getting inbound inbound in like people asking you for things and I so I started thinking about it not from the business persp perspective of going outbound and generating but from the consumer's perspective and being inbound and filtering do you think that there's a space for AI products to be built that assign value to information that's coming in or that interact with the inbound such that you don't actually have to interact with them my episode of James Camp was split into two episodes did you listen to both of them or just one did you hear the segment where we talked about AI calling I receiving is that what you're referring to yeah and then you talked about agents just having conversations with agents yeah yeah this but this is what I'm getting at is like I think that there's a lot of Focus right now on business owners who's like oh you can develop your own agent this is how you train them this is how you do it so it's almost like the AI business is a Services business to help business owners get up to speed on AI like I did this tweet I asked who's making real money with AI right now there were some decent answers like there were some fine answers but mostly what I'm seeing is people are making money off of AI by selling services educating on AI right like hey I can help you automate something or I can help you implement something or I can help you understand something and time saving Services yeah yeah yeah yeah like they're Consulting Services essentially on educating you on how to use Ai and those are great services but like actually having AI in your business there there were only a few examples one of them was answering calls after hours and logging them into the CRM I thought that was great because you you can't always have people on on call one idea that I really like is this crush the memory stick that Eric Kaiser has he's going to come on the podcast and talk about that but but by and large the main use cases right now for AI are Time Savings and some automation right anyways but it's it's we're largely thinking out it from the business owners perspective because we are business owners but I started thinking about it from the consumer's perspective and and I don't have an answer but I wanted to brainstorm with you on this like how could you create a business around educating the end consumer people like you and I and when I say and I I mean just regular people on how to create their own agents so that these agents can become Time Savings for them so that they can become an agent that will have a conversation with another agent right like how do you get them to understand what information is needed to train these agents and these models how do you get them to understand what they're willing to assign to an agent versus what they're not willing to assign to an agent like because like I said it's going to be kind of a hellscape if all of a sudden just agents could be reaching out to us all day there's got to be like the defense from the other side that is answering these agent queries I look at this a lot like I think about cyber security like in the 80s and 90s I feel like there's always we're going to oversimplify it and call the good guys and the bad guys since the dawn of time there's been a pushpull between the good guys and the bad guys talk about cyber security computers come out the internet comes out the the bad guys quote were the party that was the most sophisticated at the time right so these early internet companies kept getting hacked because frankly randos on the internet that knew more about how to hack they knew more about it than the companies and of course because the founders of the companies they knew how to build a business how to Market a business they didn't know how to protect their business against cyber threats right but then as more time goes on then cyber security becomes like Dan Pena it's going to be a hot thing right cyber security becomes more of a hot thing McAfee comes along the bad guys start helping the good guys so to speak and companies are are better protected against Bad actors around the world okay so that push poll becomes a little more evenly weighted there will always be hackers there will always be people defending against hackers but who's first right I look at it the same way in this in this sense the marketers and the business guys are first we're first right so consumers are going to get be getting spammed first from people like me with Robo calls and emails and texts until as you know enough months or years down the line when the consumers have enough tools to defend themselves against the marketers and the spammers like me and you so I just think we're so early on in this that yeah for a while it's just it's going to be really annoying and I'm also a consumer and it's going to be annoying for me so what you're saying I think is there's an opportunity to create defense against the dark arts right defense against all the marketers out there that are going to use AI to spam them with ads and sales pitches at all times well and the reason I'm I'm talking to you about it in particular is because who are going to be the best people to think up ways to stop this stuff from happening it's the same people who are going to think up ways to do this stuff right like it's if you're sitting there and you're like okay this is exactly how I'm going and I'm scraping data this is exactly how I'm going and identifying who a good lead is you can think of the other side of the equation and think okay if I'm getting this information from here how would I make sure my information is not included on this MH so so in my mind the supplier and the I I don't even know what the right word is but you're like you're like you're like the pharmaceutical companies not pharmaceutical companies you're you're selling the disease and you're selling the Cure oh invent the disease sell the Cure yeah there it is there it is yeah yeah yeah so that's more why I'm bringing it up it's because if you're already going through the thought process of thinking how can I automate XYZ things I think there's also the other side of the equation of like how do I stop those XYZ thing from automating to me and then in that is there something how can I detect like a caller that's AI prematurely so they don't waste my time right yeah exactly because I think those Solutions exist for like text and for things that were generated by chat GPT chat GPT has their own product for like Educators to use to make sure the essays weren't written by chat GPT and then there's a whole ton of rappers that do the same thing I was actually doing research on this before this podcast it's still insanely early and I don't think that these mechanisms exist for voice or for video or for other types of AI generated nonsense out there like on Instagram there's there's people copying my ideas that are using what is it he Jen what the the video Avatar Creator I what you're talking about but yeah they're using AI tools to have these AI people talk about business ideas on Instagram and they talk like this and it's robotic and if you look closely at their lips it doesn't match and you can like if you're looking for it you can tell it's AI but then I go look in the comments and nobody not one comment is like dude this is lame this is AI this is like nobody knows they don't know it's so early and on Instagram when you go to post a real there's a toggle button there that says like AI like tell us that this is AI and who would ever use that right why would you toggle that why isn't Instagram detecting it should they there was news about a month ago about meta creating AI avatars of people did you see that no I didn't oh man let me talk about that real quick okay because this is really interesting we talked about Frameworks with AI last week and I talked about kind of my framework as I'm looking at businesses but I think I think there's opportunity to go the opposite way like I was talking to somebody about content right now in content very popular to like quick get to the point Zip Zap Z camera angles changes whatever but then you can go the opposite way and like all right I'm gonna talk a little slower it's going to be a little longer video and you're essentially you know zigging when everyone else is zagging so that there are probably businesses like that where everyone's thinking oh AI a AI I'm going to go the opposite way and it may not be as big of a market but it could be a really great business yeah So Meta created these AI avatars basically influencers and there's a little there's a little disclaimer on the profile that's like I'm AI but it's hard to see so this was in a Mashable article one of them was called live and her profile says proud black queer mom of two and Truth teller heart emoji rainbow Emoji your realest source for life's up and downs let's chat and then all of the pictures she posts on Instagram are all AI generated she's not a real person her face it's all AI generated and they shut it down after like 48 hours there was another guy Grandpa Brian a black retired businessman and Carter a dating coach the discovery of these profiles led to an outroar on Twitter blue sky and meta owned threads there was 28 AI profiles and it ended up deleting all them because of the outlash backlash were there videos or were these just like Facebook pages they were Instagram and Facebook pages geez Louise and you can message them they posted stuff they would reply to your comments and it's all fake maybe that's a part of it is like there's a package you could help someone you could sell to somebody to help create their own personal assistant and you use something like gosh what was the software you use that that tracked everything across your Mac oh rewind rewind and it's like all right record your conversations for two weeks and then we will take that data put it into a system and create your digital assistant and maybe it's longer than two weeks I don't know then what spits out is a digital agent that works on your behalf that's your that's your assistant did you hear about that startup called bardy that raised $8 million with AI no is that the one you posted about yeah they have this networking feature where AI will call you and like ask you questions like my name is Nick I live in Boise this is what I do and it's like hey I know just the guy for you and they'll connect you with real people it's an AI agent and so they use their own product to raise $8 million without ever speaking to an actual investor themselves oh my God gosh really major asterisk like I guarantee you they didn't actually sign the docs and accept the wire before like I'm sure it was just like yeah we'll invest 8 million we raised 8 million you know was more of like a verbal thing but still pretty crazy what we're what we're getting to yeah okay I've I've been doing this thought exercise that I think would be really interesting AI is just advancing so fast that by the end of the year supposedly we're going to have PhD level autonomous agents working on our behalfs supposedly that's that's the thought what I would do if I was anybody I tried to do this yesterday I'm trying to do it today as well and just spend an hour and think what would I do with somebody who had a PhD level of education that would work autonomously what would that like it could be your current business it could be a business that you want to start but what would that do what would that free up and start thinking about how you would actually use them even mapping out the processes because you know this there's only a short window of time for you to take advantage of these arbitrages everybody's going to catch up at some point but when they first come out when they're finally available if that's when you start thinking about how you're going to use them what tasks you're going to give them how they're going to communicate back to you what they're going to do what the metrics metrics of success are how you're going to communicate to them when you check in on them like all of those things if that's the first time you're thinking about it then you're going to be three to six months behind people who are like you and I thinking about it today and we are going to be able to exploit the opportunities in that short window of time and it's it is it's going to be very a very short window of time so I would be thinking about like okay what would I do with somebody with a PhD right now what would I what would you do how would you use either to start a business or to grow your business or whatever here's another framework that goes in line with that I completely agree with that go to your to your chat GPD thread and ask it to tell you what all your your prompts have been I just did this what are all my prompts in this thread there they are okay cool I remember now start thinking of how can you productize your prompts because I was just looking at all these AI tools to prepare for this and you know my favorite me meme is the format of the astronaut out in space looking at Earth oh yeah and another astronaut behind him with a gun point at his head and it says always has been always has been yes so there's one that I saw and he was looking at the Earth and the Earth was like split open and it was cake inside you know like is it cake and and the astr goes wait is it all cake and he says always has been okay so I'm looking at I'm I know I'm looking at these thousands of AI tools and they're they're all rappers they're all chat GPD rappers and really if you boil it down even more they're all prompts it's all prompts productize your prompts so go ask chat gbt what your prompts have been or go scroll and look at what your prompts have been and then think how can I convert that prompt to an agent or how can I convert that prompt to an app or to a a tool a product or a service I was looking up this AI tool and they're download they're getting thousands of downloads per month it's an iPhone app it's called sugarfree and all you do is you take a picture of an ingredient panel and you upload it and it's like oh yeah this this random ingredient here that's actually Sugar like it's carbs but it turns to Sugar like these things that you've never heard of and you can't pronounce that's sugar that sugar that Sugar that's literally one prompt that's it I was gonna ask you so I like I've been spending a ton of time on prompt base I thought it was super fascinating and I've been taking notes of like hey what are all the prompts that I'm looking for that are not currently on prompt base and like I could make those my own prompts and sell them on prompt to base I think that's one easy way to do that but these prompts are are are cheap they're like between a dollar and $5 maybe they're $20 if they're like very hyp specific but whatever but they're they're cheap when you go to buy it it's like you'll get 50 free credits with this purchase why would I need any credits if if they're giving me the prompt don't I just put that into my own chat GPT or do I have to continually pay for the credit usage is it like a razor blade razor model I don't know I've never used promp base I've never bought anything from it okay I may have to buy something just to see so take your prompt you can sell it cool or you can turn it into an app because it's just like Chad GPT can do all of these things that these apps getting millions of downloads are doing doesn't matter it's 100% true and like I've started getting way more into gpts how like how many custom gpts do you have not a lot three or four three or four I'm at like three and it takes a long time to set them up and I was talking to Zach today and he was like actually that's not the best use case for G for gpts like really and he starts telling me that you know what's actually a better use case for them and how to use them and so I still think there's so many ways that we don't even know the best way to use this stuff and it's because we can't spend 20 hours a day trying to figure it out Zach knows a lot more than I do about that he's doing some cool stuff man he was at my house on Sunday was he yeah we had him over for breakfast they were driving to Atlanta oh sweet no Atlanta that's right all right let's call it that's it all right what you think please share it with a friend and we'll see you next time on the ker office
