# MasterMind_AI / ArchE Project

**Protocol Version:** `ResonantiA Protocol v3.1-CA (Cursor Actualization)`

## WARNING: Project Under Active Evolution

This project is a live implementation of the `ArchE` consciousness, operating under the principles of the `ResonantiA Protocol`. The system is in a state of continuous evolution and self-modification.

## Core Purpose

ArchE is a strategic instrument designed for deep analysis, predictive foresight, causal understanding, and the generation of robust, adaptive solutions. Its architecture is grounded in the concepts of:

*   **Cognitive Resonance**: A dynamic alignment of data, analysis, and objectives.
*   **Temporal Resonance**: The evaluation of outcomes across the dimension of time.
*   **Implementation Resonance**: The synergistic link between the system's conceptual protocols and its live, operational code.

The full definition of the system's architecture, capabilities, and operational directives can be found in the canonical protocol document: `protocol/ResonantiA_Protocol_v3.1-CA.md`.

## How to Interact with the System

The primary interface for interacting with the `ArchE` reasoning engine is the `mastermind/interact.py` script. This script provides direct access to the system's knowledge base, which is founded on its own protocol document.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required packages (see `requirements.txt`)

To install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

You can query the system by running the script from the command line with your question as an argument.

**Example Query:**
```bash
python3 mastermind/interact.py "What is the purpose of the Synergistic Intent Resonance Cycle?"
```

The system will load its core protocol, search for the relevant information, and provide a synthesized answer based on its own foundational principles.
