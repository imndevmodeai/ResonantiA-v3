Conduct a comprehensive, multi-phase strategic analysis to create a business plan for a new venture, codenamed 'Project Janus'. The venture will be founded by a Keyholder who is NOT an expert in software development but has strong business acumen, strategic thinking, and deep philosophical reasoning capabilities. The mission is to achieve a minimum of $5 million in annual revenue within 3 years. The initial capital investment is strictly limited to $1000 USD, supplemented by a $50/week operational budget. The business model must evolve towards a passive or semi-passive state.

The Keyholder's actual strengths include:
- Strong business strategy and market analysis skills
- Deep philosophical reasoning and critical thinking
- Excellent communication and relationship building
- Understanding of human psychology and behavior
- Strategic planning and execution capabilities
- Ability to identify market opportunities and trends

The Keyholder's limitations include:
- Limited technical programming skills
- No deep expertise in web development, AI integration, or technical implementation
- Will need to rely on contractors, partners, or no-code/low-code solutions for technical execution

Your analysis must first perform a `Knowledge Scaffolding` phase to identify high-margin, low-capital market opportunities that are uniquely suited to the founder's actual skill set (business strategy, philosophy, communication) rather than technical skills. Second, in your `Advanced Insight Generation` phase, you must use `CausalInference` to identify the primary drivers of client value in the chosen niche and `AgentBasedModeling` to simulate the most viable growth trajectory (e.g., consulting vs. digital products vs. partnerships). Finally, in your `Fused Strategy Generation` phase, synthesize all findings into a detailed, actionable, year-by-year business plan. This plan must include the initial product/service offering, a 3-year revenue model, a marketing and client acquisition strategy, and a concrete list of the first three actions to be taken within the next 24 hours.

Focus on business models that leverage the Keyholder's actual strengths while minimizing reliance on technical implementation skills.
