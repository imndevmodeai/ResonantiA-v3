### Lesson 2: Principles Guide Evolution
The philosophical foundations (Cognitive Resonance, "As Above So Below", etc.) guided every transformation.

### Lesson 3: Problems Drive Solutions
Each milestone solved a real problem. Evolution was driven by necessity, not abstraction.

### Lesson 4: Safety Enables Risk
Guardian review enabled risky self-modification. Safety mechanisms enable bold evolution.
