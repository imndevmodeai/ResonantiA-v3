## Executive Summary

- **Total Components Analyzed**: 213
- **Critical Issues**: 31
- **Missing Implementations**: 31
- **Undocumented Implementations**: 128
- **Low Alignment Components (<70%)**: 149
- **SPR Blueprint Issues**: To be detailed

## Gap Categories

### 1. Critical Severity Issues (31)
Components with critical alignment problems requiring immediate attention.

### 2. Missing Implementations (31)
Components specified in documentation but not implemented in code.

### 3. Undocumented Implementations (128)
Code exists but lacks corresponding specification documentation.

### 4. Low Alignment Components (149)
Components below 70% alignment threshold needing improvement.

### 5. SPR Blueprint Issues
SPR definitions with invalid or missing blueprint_details references.

---

## Recommended Fix Order

### Phase 1: Critical + Missing (Priority 1)
Fix these first - highest impact on alignment score.

### Phase 2: Documentation (Priority 2)
Create specifications for undocumented implementations.

### Phase 3: Alignment Improvement (Priority 3)
Improve low-alignment components systematically.

### Phase 4: SPR Blueprint Validation (Priority 4)
Fix invalid SPR blueprint_details references.

## Next Steps

1. Run detailed analysis script to get full gap list
2. Categorize gaps by fix complexity
3. Begin Phase 1 fixes using CRDSP v3.1
4. Re-verify after each batch of fixes
