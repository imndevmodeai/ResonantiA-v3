**Source:** Keyholder Directive `LIVE_VALIDATION_MANDATE_INTEGRATION_001` - Enhanced
**Governs:** `Implementation resonancE`, `CRDSP v3.1`, Tool Development & Validation, Real-World Integration

### Principle:
To ensure true and unwavering **Implementation resonancE**, the validation of all **Cognitive toolS** that interact with external systems (e.g., APIs, databases, web services, file systems, real-time data sources) **MUST** be performed against the **live, real-world systems** they are designed to interact with.
