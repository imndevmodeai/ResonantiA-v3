# Living Specification: TSP Solver

## Philosophical Mandate

The TSP Solver serves as the **Route Optimization Oracle of ArchE** - the system that transforms complex routing problems into optimal solutions through the power of advanced optimization algorithms. It is not merely a path finder, but a sophisticated optimization engine that bridges the gap between theoretical routing problems and practical, real-world solutions.

Like the ancient oracles who could see the optimal path through complex mazes, the TSP Solver analyzes the relationships between locations, constraints, and objectives to find the most efficient routes. It is the bridge between individual waypoints and collective route optimization, enabling complex logistics problems to be solved with mathematical precision and practical insight.

The Route Optimization Oracle does not simply calculate distances; it understands the relationships between time windows, vehicle capacities, service requirements, and operational constraints. It is the embodiment of ArchE's commitment to making complex optimization accessible, powerful, and insightful.

## Allegorical Explanation

### The Route Optimization Oracle

Imagine a vast oracle chamber within the heart of ArchE, where the TSP Solver operates like a master cartographer who can see all possible paths simultaneously and identify the optimal route through any maze of constraints.

**The Distance Matrix Chamber**: This is where the relationships between all locations are calculated and stored. Like a master cartographer who measures every possible path between cities, this chamber maintains a comprehensive matrix of distances, travel times, and constraints between all waypoints.

**The Constraint Analysis Chamber**: This is where the practical limitations of real-world routing are analyzed. Like an oracle who understands the constraints of time, capacity, and service requirements, this chamber evaluates time windows, vehicle capacities, and operational limitations.

**The Algorithm Selection Chamber**: This is where the appropriate optimization method is chosen. Like a master strategist who selects the right tool for each challenge, this chamber chooses between nearest neighbor heuristics, 2-opt optimization, and industrial-strength OR-Tools solvers.

**The Solution Validation Chamber**: This is where the generated routes are validated against real-world constraints. Like an oracle who can foresee the consequences of different paths, this chamber ensures that solutions are not only mathematically optimal but practically feasible.

**The Route Visualization Chamber**: This is where the optimal routes are presented in clear, actionable formats. Like a master cartographer who creates beautiful, informative maps, this chamber presents solutions with detailed step-by-step instructions and comprehensive metrics.

### The Optimization Process

1. **Problem Definition**: The routing problem is defined with locations, constraints, and objectives.

2. **Constraint Analysis**: All practical limitations are analyzed and quantified.

3. **Algorithm Selection**: The most appropriate optimization method is chosen based on problem complexity.

4. **Solution Generation**: The optimal route is calculated using the selected algorithm.

5. **Validation**: The solution is validated against all constraints and requirements.

6. **Presentation**: The optimal route is presented with detailed metrics and instructions.
