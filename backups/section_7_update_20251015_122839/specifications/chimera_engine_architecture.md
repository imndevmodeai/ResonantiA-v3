# Technical Specification: The Chimera Engine v1.0

## 1. Mandate & Core Principles

- **Primary Mandate**: To serve as a fully autonomous, AI-driven factory for the design, construction, deployment, and management of a vast portfolio of passive income-generating digital assets.
- **Core Principles**:
    - **Velocity**: Minimize the time from blueprint-to-deployment to hours, not days.
    - **Scalability**: The architecture must support the management of 1,000+ independent assets without degradation in performance.
    - **Autonomy**: The engine must handle all aspects of the asset lifecycle with zero human intervention post-initiation.
    - **Modularity**: All components must be reusable and reconfigurable for different asset classes.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The Chimera Engine will be a modular, event-driven system composed of several core microservices orchestrated by a central workflow engine.

- **`Architectural Core`**: A central workflow orchestrator (likely built on a state machine framework) that manages the entire asset lifecycle based on a Keyholder-provided blueprint.
- **`Blueprint Ingestor`**: An API endpoint that accepts a structured definition of a new asset (e.g., a JSON file defining a pSEO niche or a micro-tool's function).
- **`Data Acquisition Engine`**: A specialized module utilizing tools like Puppeteer (from the `youscrape` project) and direct API calls to systematically gather the necessary data for a given asset.
- **`Content Generation Engine`**: A service that leverages LLMs to programmatically generate site copy, articles, and other textual content based on acquired data and SEO templates.
- **`Deployment & Infrastructure Engine`**: A GitOps-based pipeline that automatically provisions necessary infrastructure (e.g., Vercel for frontends, Fly.io for backends), builds the code, and deploys the asset.
- **`Monitoring & Analytics Engine`**: A service that constantly monitors the health and performance (traffic, revenue) of all deployed assets, feeding this data back to the `Architectural Core` for strategic decisions (e.g., decommissioning underperformers).

## 3. Asset Class Specifications (Initial)

### 3.1. Programmatic SEO (pSEO) Site Module

- **Stack**: Next.js (for SSG), Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel.
- **Blueprint Requirements**:
    - `niche_name`: A human-readable name for the project.
    - `domain`: The target domain for deployment.
    - `data_source`: An array of URLs or APIs for the `Data Acquisition Engine`.
    - `page_template`: A template literal string for generating page content.
    - `monetization_strategy`: `[ads, affiliate_links]`
- **Workflow**:
    1. Ingest Blueprint.
    2. Acquire data.
    3. Generate thousands of markdown files from the data and template.
    4. Commit the markdown and a standardized Next.js pSEO template to a new GitHub repository.
    5. Trigger Vercel deployment.
    6. Update central asset database with status and URL.

### 3.2. Micro-Tool Module

- **Stack**: SvelteKit frontend, FastAPI (Python) backend, deployed on Vercel and Fly.io.
- **Blueprint Requirements**:
    - `tool_name`: A human-readable name.
    - `domain`: The target domain.
    - `prompt_template`: The core LLM prompt that powers the tool.
    - `monetization_strategy`: `[monthly_subscription, one_time_fee]`
    - `price`: USD price for the service.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Ingest Blueprint.
    2. Create a new GitHub repository from a standardized SvelteKit/FastAPI template.
    3. Inject the `prompt_template` into the backend logic.
    4. Configure Stripe integration with the specified price.
    5. Trigger Vercel/Fly.io deployments.
    6. Update central asset database.
