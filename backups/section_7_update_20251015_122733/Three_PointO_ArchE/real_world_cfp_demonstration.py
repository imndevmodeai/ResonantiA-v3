            A Fortune 500 company is experiencing significant challenges with their customer service system:
            
            CURRENT PAIN POINTS:
            • 45% of customer queries require human escalation (target: <15%)
            • Average response time: 3.2 minutes (target: <30 seconds)
            • Customer satisfaction: 67% (target: >90%)
            • System downtime: 2.3% (target: <0.1%)
            • Cost per interaction: $12.50 (target: <$3.00)
            • Agent burnout rate: 34% annually (target: <10%)
            
            BUSINESS IMPACT:
            • Lost revenue: $2.3M annually due to poor customer experience
            • Operational costs: $8.7M annually for customer service
            • Brand reputation damage: 23% customer churn rate
            • Competitive disadvantage: 15% slower time-to-resolution vs competitors
            
            TECHNICAL CHALLENGES:
            • 5 different AI modules working in isolation
            • No intelligent routing between modules
            • Inconsistent performance across different query types
            • Poor scalability during peak hours (300% traffic spikes)
            • Security vulnerabilities in module interactions
