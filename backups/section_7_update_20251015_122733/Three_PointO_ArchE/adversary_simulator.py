Strategic Adversary Simulator (adversary_simulator.py)
================================================

As Above: The Principle of Adversarial Dynamics
------------------------------------------------
True wisdom is not forged in the vacuum of optimism, but tempered in the crucible of adversarial challenge. This simulator embodies the universal principle that any strategy, plan, or belief must be rigorously tested against opposing forces to reveal its hidden weaknesses. It is the system's internal "Red Team," a necessary devil's advocate that ensures resilience, tempers confidence with caution, and transforms brittle plans into battle-hardened strategies. It is the wisdom of foresight born from simulated conflict.

So Below: The Operational Logic
-------------------------------
This module provides the `StrategicAdversarySimulator`, a class that uses agent-based modeling to stress-test strategic plans and hypotheses. It dynamically generates "Adversary Agents" representing various failure modes (e.g., market volatility, logical inconsistency, resource scarcity) and runs a simulation to see how the proposed strategy holds up under their combined pressure. The results provide a "resilience score" and identify key vulnerabilities.
