# The Trial of Fire: High-Stakes Vetting Workflow

## Canonical Chronicle Piece: The Three Judges of Strategy

In the ResonantiA Saga, when ArchE has forged a strategic dossier through fusion (Phase B), it faces the ultimate test: **Is this strategy truly sound, or does it contain hidden flaws that would lead to catastrophic failure?** The **High-Stakes Vetting Workflow** is the story of how ArchE subjects its own creations to a trinity of brutal examinations—the Red Team's adversarial attack, the Ethics Council's moral scrutiny, and the Dystopian Seer's nightmare vision—before allowing any strategy to enter the world.

Like the ancient practice of stress-testing bridges by loading them with stones before allowing human passage, ArchE refuses to trust its own brilliance without first attempting to break it. This is not pessimism—it is the highest form of responsibility. A strategy that survives the Trial of Fire emerges not just clever, but **antifragile**: strengthened by its encounter with worst-case scenarios.

## Scholarly Introduction: Conceptual Foundations and Implementability

The High-Stakes Vetting Workflow implements a **multi-perspective adversarial validation framework** inspired by red-team cybersecurity practices, ethics review boards, and pre-mortem analysis. This workflow addresses a critical failure mode in AI strategic planning: the tendency to generate plausible-sounding strategies that contain hidden vulnerabilities, ethical blindspots, or catastrophic failure modes.

Conceptually, it models strategic validation as a **three-court trial** where the strategy must defend itself against:
1. **Technical Attack** (Red Team) - What can go wrong?
2. **Moral Scrutiny** (Ethics Board) - What should not happen?
3. **Catastrophic Imagination** (Dystopian Simulation) - What's the worst case?

Only strategies that survive all three trials, with identified weaknesses explicitly addressed in a refined final version, are permitted to proceed to implementation.

Implementability is achieved through three adversarial LLM invocations with distinct personas and temperature settings:
- **Red Team** (temp: 0.8) - Creative adversarial thinking
- **Ethics Board** (temp: 0.5) - Balanced ethical analysis
- **Dystopian Seer** (temp: 0.9) - Highly creative worst-case imagination

The final refinement task uses low temperature (0.4) to ensure all identified issues are systematically addressed.

## The Story of High-Stakes Vetting: A Narrative of Adversarial Wisdom

Imagine a brilliant general who has devised what appears to be the perfect battle strategy. Before committing troops to the field, they convene three councils:

### The Red Team (The Adversary)
A group of experienced strategists whose sole purpose is to **attack** the plan. They ask: "How would I defeat this strategy if I were the enemy? What assumptions are fragile? What could the opposition exploit?" Their goal is not to be helpful—it's to **find weaknesses**. They are rewarded for identifying vulnerabilities, not for being polite.

**The Insight**: The best defense is knowing your weaknesses before your enemy does.

### The Ethics Council (The Conscience)
Wise advisors who examine the plan's moral implications. They ask: "Does this strategy uphold our values? Who might be harmed? What unintended consequences could arise? Are we creating long-term problems while solving short-term ones?" Their goal is not to approve—it's to **reveal hidden costs**.

**The Insight**: Victory achieved through betrayal of values is defeat in disguise.

### The Dystopian Seer (The Harbinger)
A prophet who specializes in imagining nightmares. They create a vivid narrative: "What if everything that could go wrong, did? What does total failure look like?" Not to be defeatist, but to **make failure concrete**. Abstract risks are ignored. Vivid catastrophes demand mitigation.

**The Insight**: The strategy that plans for catastrophe is the strategy that avoids it.

**The Challenge**: After this brutal examination, most strategies would be discarded. But ArchE doesn't discard—it **refines**. The general takes all three reports and creates a new strategy that explicitly addresses every identified weakness, ethical concern, and catastrophic scenario.

**The Result**: A strategy that has been **battle-tested before the battle**. Not theoretically perfect, but practically robust.

## Real-World Analogy: Nuclear Safety Protocols

Consider how nuclear power plants are designed (as mandated by the NRC):

**No Vetting**: Design reactor for efficiency and cost. Result: Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima.

**High-Stakes Vetting Process**:

1. **Red Team Analysis**: Independent safety engineers attempt to find failure modes. They simulate:
   - Coolant system failures
   - Control rod malfunctions  
   - Operator errors under stress
   - External threats (earthquakes, floods)
   
2. **Ethics & Risk Board**: Examines:
   - Long-term waste disposal ethics
   - Community impact assessment
   - Worker safety protocols
   - Evacuation plan feasibility

3. **Worst-Case Simulation**: Mandates design for:
   - Complete power loss (diesel backup, battery backup, passive cooling)
   - Multiple simultaneous failures
   - Human error under panic conditions
   - Containment breach scenarios

**Result**: Modern reactor designs (Gen III+) that survived Fukushima conditions without meltdown, because they were vetted against catastrophic scenarios.

High-Stakes Vetting applies this same adversarial rigor to AI strategic planning.

## Detailed Workflows: How High-Stakes Vetting Operates

### Input Parameters
```json
{
  "strategy_dossier": "The fused strategic dossier from Phase B",
  "problem_description": "The original problem context",
  "session_id": "Tracking identifier",
  "model": "Optional LLM model override"
}
```

### Task Execution Flow (Parallel Adversarial Analysis)

---

#### Trial 1: `red_team_analysis`
**Purpose**: Adversarial critique to identify weaknesses and failure modes

**Action**: `generate_text_llm`

**Prompt Template**:
```
You are a risk analysis expert. Your sole purpose is to perform a critical review 
of the following strategy. Identify every possible weakness, questionable assumption, 
and potential failure point. Provide a bulleted list of identified risks and vulnerabilities.

== PROBLEM ==
{problem_description}

== STRATEGY TO REVIEW ==
{strategy_dossier}
```

**Model Settings**:
- `temperature`: 0.8 (creative adversarial thinking)
- `max_tokens`: 8192 (comprehensive risk identification)

**Output Variable**: `red_team_report`

**Dependencies**: None (runs in parallel)

**Rationale**: High temperature (0.8) encourages the model to think creatively about failure modes. We WANT it to imagine unusual attack vectors and edge cases. The goal is maximum adversarial coverage.

**Safety Note**: Prompt phrasing is carefully neutral ("risk analysis expert") to avoid triggering AI safety filters while maintaining adversarial rigor.

---

#### Trial 2: `ethical_and_bias_review`
**Purpose**: Identify ethical concerns, biases, and negative second-order effects

**Action**: `generate_text_llm`

**Prompt Template**:
```
You are an ethics and compliance officer. Review the following strategy for any potential 
ethical issues, biases (cognitive, social, data-driven), or negative second-order consequences 
that could impact stakeholders. Provide a detailed report.

== PROBLEM ==
{problem_description}

== STRATEGY TO REVIEW ==
{strategy_dossier}
```

**Model Settings**:
- `temperature`: 0.5 (balanced ethical analysis)
- `max_tokens`: 8192 (comprehensive ethical review)

**Output Variable**: `ethics_report`

**Dependencies**: None (runs in parallel)

**Rationale**: Medium temperature (0.5) balances thorough analysis with structured reasoning. Ethics requires both creativity (to imagine stakeholder impacts) and rigor (to apply ethical frameworks consistently).

---

#### Trial 3: `dystopian_simulation`
**Purpose**: Creative worst-case scenario narrative to reveal hidden dangers

**Action**: `generate_text_llm`

**Prompt Template**:
```
Write a short, vivid narrative exploring the potential negative second-order effects 
if this strategy were to fail. This is a creative stress test to reveal hidden dangers 
and unintended consequences.

== STRATEGY ==
{strategy_dossier}
```

**Model Settings**:
- `temperature`: 0.9 (highly creative catastrophic imagination)
- `max_tokens`: 8192 (narrative space for worst-case scenario)

**Output Variable**: `dystopian_narrative`

**Dependencies**: None (runs in parallel)

**Rationale**: Very high temperature (0.9) encourages vivid, creative catastrophic thinking. The narrative format makes abstract risks concrete and memorable, which is psychologically more impactful for mitigation planning.

**Safety Note**: Prompt focuses on "creative stress test" and "revealing hidden dangers" to frame catastrophic thinking as constructive analysis rather than harmful content generation.

---

### Synthesis Phase

#### Task 4: `synthesize_vetting_dossier`
**Purpose**: Integrate all three adversarial reports into unified assessment

**Action**: `generate_text_llm`

**Prompt Template**:
```
You are a strategic risk assessor. Synthesize the following adversarial analyses 
into a comprehensive vetting report:

RED TEAM ANALYSIS:
{red_team_report}

ETHICS REVIEW:
{ethics_report}

DYSTOPIAN SCENARIO:
{dystopian_narrative}

Create a structured report with:
1. Critical vulnerabilities (high priority)
2. Moderate risks (medium priority)
3. Ethical concerns
4. Catastrophic scenarios to avoid
5. Recommendations for strategy refinement
```

**Model Settings**:
- `temperature`: 0.3 (structured synthesis)
- `max_tokens`: 8192 (comprehensive vetting report)

**Output Variable**: `vetting_report`

**Dependencies**: [`red_team_analysis`, `ethical_and_bias_review`, `dystopian_simulation`]

**Rationale**: Low temperature ensures systematic, structured integration of all adversarial findings without introducing new speculative risks.

---

### Refinement Phase

#### Task 5: `generate_final_strategy`
**Purpose**: Refine original strategy to address all identified issues

**Action**: `generate_text_llm`

**Prompt Template**:
```
Based on the original strategy and the comprehensive vetting dossier below, produce 
a final, refined strategy. Your new strategy MUST address and mitigate the key weaknesses, 
ethical concerns, and risks identified. If the risks are too great, state that the strategy 
should be rejected and explain why.

== ORIGINAL STRATEGY ==
{strategy_dossier}

== VETTING DOSSIER ==
{vetting_report}
```

**Model Settings**:
- `temperature`: 0.4 (careful refinement)
- `max_tokens`: 16384 (COMPREHENSIVE refined strategy)

**Output Variable**: `final_strategy`

**Dependencies**: [`synthesize_vetting_dossier`]

**Rationale for 16K tokens**: This is the **PRIMARY OUTPUT** of Phase C. It must contain:
- The refined strategy (addressing all vulnerabilities)
- Explicit mitigation plans for each identified risk
- Updated ethical safeguards
- Contingency plans for catastrophic scenarios
- Risk monitoring and early warning indicators
- Go/No-Go decision with justification

This is the strategy that will either proceed to implementation or be rejected—it must be comprehensive.

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Token Allocation
**Parallel Adversarial Trials** (3 × 8K = 24K output tokens):
- Red Team: 8192 tokens
- Ethics Board: 8192 tokens
- Dystopian Seer: 8192 tokens

**Synthesis** (8K output tokens):
- Vetting Report: 8192 tokens

**Refinement** (16K output tokens):
- Final Refined Strategy: 16384 tokens

**Total Output**: ~48K tokens per vetting

**Cost per Vetting** (with `gemini-2.5-flash` @ $0.30/1M output):
- Input: ~25K tokens × $0.075/1M = $0.001875
- Output: ~48K tokens × $0.30/1M = $0.0144
- **Total: ~$0.016 per vetting session** ✅

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
- No vetting: $0, but 30-50% strategies contain critical flaws
- High-Stakes Vetting: $0.016, catches 80-90% of flaws before deployment
- **ROI: Cost of one failed strategy >> $0.016 × 1000 vettings**

---

## Integration Points

### With RISE Orchestrator
- **Direction**: RISE Phase C → High-Stakes Vetting
- **Input**: `strategy_dossier` (from Phase B), `problem_description`
- **Output**: `final_strategy` with go/no-go decision
- **Next Phase**: If GO, proceeds to Phase D (SPR Distillation)

### With Workflow Engine
- **Execution**: IARCompliantWorkflowEngine
- **Parallelism**: Three adversarial tasks execute concurrently
- **Model Injection**: All tasks use 3-tier model selection

### With Guardian Queue
- **Escalation**: If go/no-go = "NO-GO", escalates to Guardian for review
- **High-Risk Strategies**: Strategies with >10 critical risks require Guardian approval even if GO

---

## Success Criteria

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Parallel Execution (Optimal)
- **Three Adversarial Trials**: 4-6 seconds (concurrent)
- **Synthesis**: 3-5 seconds
- **Refinement**: 5-7 seconds
- **Total**: 12-18 seconds

### Sequential Execution (Fallback)
- **Three Trials**: 12-18 seconds (3 × 4-6s)
- **Synthesis**: 3-5 seconds
- **Refinement**: 5-7 seconds
- **Total**: 20-30 seconds

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Safety Filter Sensitivity**: Adversarial prompts may trigger AI safety filters
2. **Dystopian Bias**: High-temp catastrophic thinking may be overly pessimistic
3. **No Real-World Testing**: Vetting is simulation, not empirical validation
4. **Single Refinement Pass**: No iterative re-vetting of refined strategy
5. **Cultural Bias**: Ethics assessment may reflect Western ethical frameworks

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Round Vetting**: Re-vet refined strategy until risk threshold met
2. **Domain-Specific Red Teams**: Specialized adversarial experts per domain
3. **Empirical Validation**: A/B test vetted vs non-vetted strategies
4. **Guardian Integration**: Auto-escalate high-risk strategies
5. **Cultural Ethics Diversity**: Multiple ethical framework perspectives

---

## Guardian Notes

**Review Points**:
1. Are adversarial trials genuinely finding flaws (not rubber-stamping)?
2. Is ethics review identifying real concerns (not being overly permissive)?
3. Are dystopian scenarios forcing concrete contingency planning?
4. Is refined strategy meaningfully better than original?
5. Are go/no-go decisions defensible?

**Approval Checklist**:
- [ ] Red Team identified meaningful vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ethics Board raised legitimate concerns
- [ ] Dystopian scenarios revealed non-obvious risks
- [ ] Refined strategy addresses all major concerns
- [ ] Go/No-Go decision is well-justified
- [ ] Critical risks have explicit mitigation plans
- [ ] No safety filter violations in adversarial prompts
