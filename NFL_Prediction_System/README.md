```python
import ultimate_gambling_engine as uge

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = uge.AdaptiveCognitiveOrchestrator(
    protocol_chunks=["NFL", "Football", "Strategy", "Quantum"],
    llm_provider=uge.enhanced_llm_provider
)

# Process complex query
query = "Analyze strategic matchup between Chiefs and Bills considering quantum dynamics"
result, metadata = orchestrator.process_query_with_evolution(query)

print(f"Result: {result}")
print(f"Active Domain: {metadata['active_domain']}")
```

2. **Update Actual Results**: Once you have the actual game outcomes, use the `/api/update-actual-results` endpoint to update the prediction records with real results.

3. **Track Performance**: The `/api/performance-history` endpoint provides real-time accuracy metrics based on your prediction history.

### Example Usage

```bash
# Generate predictions for Week 1 of the 2023 season
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/historical-analysis/2023/1"

# Update actual results (example data)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/update-actual-results" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "game_1": {
      "winner": "Kansas City Chiefs",
      "team1_score": 35,
      "team2_score": 28
    }
  }'

# Check performance metrics
