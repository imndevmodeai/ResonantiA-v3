# --- Comprehensive Setup and Run Script for VCD Environment ---
# This script ensures a clean, consistent environment for running ArchE and the VCD.
# It will:
# 1. Stop any running services.
# 2. Delete the old Python virtual environment to prevent stale package issues.
# 3. Recreate the Python virtual environment.
# 4. Install all required Python packages.
# 5. Set the necessary PYTHONPATH.
# 6. Start the backend and frontend services.
