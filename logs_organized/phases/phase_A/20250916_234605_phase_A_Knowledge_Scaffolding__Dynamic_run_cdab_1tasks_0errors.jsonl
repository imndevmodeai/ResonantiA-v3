The synthesize_fused_dossier task has the right dependencies. The issue might be that the workflow engine is not executing the synthesis task after the pathway tasks complete. Let me check the workflow engine's task execution logic:\nI can see the issue! Looking at the workflow engine code, I can see that it has sophisticated dependency handling logic. The problem is likely in the task execution loop. Let me check if there's an issue with how the synthesize_fused_dossier task is being processed.\nLooking at the workflow execution logic in workflow_engine.py, I can see that it processes tasks in a loop and checks dependencies. The issue might be that the synthesis task is not being added to the ready_tasks set after the pathway tasks complete.\nLet me check the VCD Bridge logs more carefully to see if there are any error messages about the synthesis task:\nI can see that the workflow is finishing with \"Completed with Errors\" status, which suggests that the synthesis task is failing to execute. The issue is that the workflow engine is not executing the synthesize_fused_dossier task at all.\nLet me check if there's an issue with the template variable resolution in the synthesis task. The synthesis task uses template variables like {{ pathway_analytical_insight.result.generated_text }} which might not be resolving correctly.\nLet me check the workflow engine's template resolution logic more carefully:\nPerfect! I found the issue. Looking at the template resolution logic in workflow_engine.py, I can see that the _resolve_template_variables method (lines 487-542) handles template variables like {{ pathway_analytical_insight.result.generated_text }}.\nThe issue is likely that the template variables in the synthesis task are not resolving correctly because the pathway tasks are storing their results in a different structure than expected.\nLet me check what the actual structure of the pathway task results is by looking at the log file more carefully:\nPerfect! I can see that the pathway tasks are producing results with the structure result.result.generated_text. The issue is that the synthesis task template is trying to access {{ pathway_analytical_insight.result.generated_text }}, but the actual structure is {{ pathway_analytical_insight.result.result.generated_text }}.\nLet me fix the template variables in the synthesis task:\nNow let me test the system again to see if the synthesis task works:\nThe system is still failing. Let me check the latest workflow execution log to see if the synthesis task is now being executed:\nLet me check the most recent log file:\nThat's strange - it's showing an old file. Let me check the VCD Bridge logs to see what's happening:\nI can see there's a new log file: run_events_run_9bcee2b3e4634f26a15721d3eb475572.jsonl. Let me check this file:\nExcellent! I can see that all three pathway tasks are now working perfectly and generating high-quality content. However, I notice that the synthesize_fused_dossier task is still missing from this log file, which means it's still not being executed.\nThe issue is that the workflow engine is not executing the synthesis task after the pathway tasks complete. This suggests there's a problem with the dependency resolution or task execution logic.\nLet me update the TODO and then check if there's an issue with the workflow engine's task execution loop:\nDebug why synthesis task is not being executed after pathway tasks complete\nLooking at the VCD Bridge logs, I can see that the workflow engine is identifying the initial ready tasks as ['pathway_creative_insight', 'pathway_analytical_insight', 'pathway_specialist_consultation'], but it's not adding the synthesize_fused_dossier task to the ready tasks after the pathway tasks complete.\nThe issue is likely in the workflow engine's task execution loop. Let me check if there's a problem with how it handles task completion and dependency resolution. Looking at the workflow engine code, I can see that after a task completes, it should check for newly ready tasks.\nLet me check if there's an issue with the task execution logic by looking at the workflow engine's task completion handling:\nPerfect! I found the issue. Looking at the workflow engine's run_workflow method (lines 1394-1399), I can see the logic for adding newly ready tasks after a task completes:\nThis logic looks correct. The issue might be that the workflow engine is not properly detecting that the pathway tasks have completed successfully, or there's an issue with the task execution loop.\nLooking at the VCD Bridge logs, I can see that the workflow is finishing with \"Completed with Errors\" status, which suggests that one of the tasks is failing. The issue might be that the synthesis task is failing during template resolution, causing the workflow to terminate early.\nLet me check if there's an issue with the template resolution by adding some debug logging. But first, let me check if the synthesis task is actually being attempted by looking for any error messages in the logs:\nwhy isnt their the knowledge scoffding taking place @rise_orchestrator.md  @cognitive_resonant_controller.md \n\nLooking at the RISE orchestrator documentation and the current issue, I can see that the knowledge scaffolding (Phase A) should be happening before the strategy fusion (Phase B), but it's not being executed. Let me investigate why the knowledge scaffolding workflow isn't running.\nNow let me check the actual Phase A execution in the RISE orchestrator:\nNow let me check the main RISE workflow execution to see if Phase A is being called:\nPerfect! I can see that Phase A (knowledge scaffolding) IS being executed in the RISE workflow. Looking at lines 590-596, Phase A is called and its results are stored in the rise_state.\nThe issue is that the knowledge scaffolding workflow (knowledge_scaffolding.json) is likely failing, and the system is falling back to the fallback knowledge base (lines 685-712). This means the system is not actually acquiring real domain knowledge - it's just using a generic \"Strategic Analysis\" fallback.\nLet me check if the knowledge scaffolding workflow exists and what might be causing it to fail:\nI found several issues with the knowledge scaffolding workflow:\nJSON Syntax Error: There's a missing comma after the acquire_domain_knowledge task (line 42)\nTemplate Variable Issues: The workflow uses {{problem_description}} instead of {{ context.problem_description }}\nMissing Model Settings: Some tasks don't have proper model_settings structure\nLet me fix these issues:\nNow let me fix the other template variables and model settings:\nNow let me fix the remaining template variables and model settings:\nNow let me fix the condition and the code execution task:\nNow let me update the TODO and test the system to see if the knowledge scaffolding is working:\nDebug why synthesis task is not being executed after pathway tasks complete\nFix knowledge scaffolding workflow template variables and JSON syntax\nTest complete RISE workflow with knowledge scaffolding and strategy fusion\nNow let me test the system to see if the knowledge scaffolding is working:\nThe system is still failing. Let me check the VCD Bridge logs to see what's happening with the knowledge scaffolding:\n...\n\n\n\n\\n\\nIdentify:\\n1. Core domain areas\\n2. Key variables and unknowns\\n3.
