Executive Summary:**\n\nThis report assesses the ethical implications, potential biases, and second-order consequences of the proposed strategy outlined in the provided dossier ({strategy_dossier_str}).  The analysis considers cognitive, social, and data-driven biases, and evaluates the impact on various stakeholders.  [Insert a brief, high-level summary of your findings here.  E.g., \"The strategy, while aiming to address [problem summary], presents significant risks of [mention key ethical concerns or biases], potentially harming [mention key stakeholder groups].  Mitigating actions are recommended to ensure ethical and responsible implementation.\"]\n\n\n**2. Problem Description Summary:**\n\n[Summarize the {problem_description} concisely here.  Focus on the core issue the strategy aims to solve. This should be a brief, objective statement.]\n\n\n**3. Strategy Dossier Summary:**\n\n[Summarize the {strategy_dossier_str} concisely here.  Highlight key components, target groups, methods, and expected outcomes.  Avoid subjective interpretations at this stage; focus on objective description.]\n\n\n**4. Ethical Analysis:**\n\nThis section analyzes the strategy for potential ethical issues, categorized for clarity:\n\n* **Fairness and Equity:**  [Analyze the strategy's fairness across different stakeholder groups.  Does it disproportionately benefit or harm specific demographics?  Are there potential biases in the selection criteria or implementation process?  Examples:  Gender, race, socioeconomic status, age, disability.]\n\n* **Transparency and Accountability:** [Assess the transparency of the strategy's goals, methods, and metrics.  Is there a clear chain of accountability for its implementation and outcomes?  Are there mechanisms for oversight and redress of grievances?]\n\n* **Privacy and Data Security:** [If the strategy involves data collection or processing, evaluate its compliance with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).  Are appropriate data security measures in place to protect sensitive information?  Is data anonymization or de-identification employed where necessary?]\n\n* **Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure:** [Determine whether the strategy requires handling confidential information.  Are appropriate protocols in place to maintain confidentiality and prevent unauthorized disclosure?]\n\n* **Conflicts of Interest:** [Identify any potential conflicts of interest for individuals or organizations involved in the strategy's development or implementation.]\n\n* **Respect for Persons:** [Does the strategy treat all individuals with dignity and respect?  Does it avoid manipulation, coercion, or undue influence?]\n\n\n**5. Bias Analysis:**\n\nThis section identifies potential biases that could affect the strategy's effectiveness and fairness:\n\n* **Cognitive Biases:** [Analyze for potential cognitive biases such as confirmation bias (seeking only confirming evidence), anchoring bias (over-reliance on initial information), availability heuristic (overestimating the likelihood of easily recalled events), etc.  Provide specific examples from the strategy.]\n\n* **Social Biases:** [Analyze for potential social biases such as implicit bias (unconscious stereotypes), in-group bias (favoring one's own group), confirmation bias (seeking only confirming evidence), etc.  Provide specific examples from the strategy.]\n\n* **Data-Driven Biases:** [If the strategy relies on data, analyze for potential biases in the data itself, such as sampling bias (non-representative sample), measurement bias (inaccurate or inconsistent measurement), or algorithmic bias (bias embedded in algorithms used to process data).  Provide specific examples from the strategy.]\n\n\n**6. Second-Order Consequences:**\n\nThis section identifies potential unintended negative consequences of the strategy:\n\n[Analyze potential unintended consequences. Consider ripple effects across different stakeholder groups and systems. Examples:  Unforeseen financial impacts, reputational damage, legal challenges, exacerbation of existing inequalities,  creation of new problems.]\n\n\n**7. Recommendations:**\n\n[Based on the analysis, provide specific recommendations to mitigate identified ethical issues, biases, and negative second-order consequences. This should include concrete actions and timelines.  Examples:  Conducting a bias audit, implementing fairness guidelines, enhancing transparency mechanisms, strengthening data security protocols, establishing independent oversight, conducting stakeholder consultations.]\n\n\n**8. Conclusion:**\n\n[Summarize the key findings and recommendations.  Reiterate the overall assessment of the strategy's ethical soundness and propose a course of action.]\n\n\n**Note:** This template requires the input of \"{problem_description}\" and \"{strategy_dossier_str}\" to generate a complete and relevant ethical review.
