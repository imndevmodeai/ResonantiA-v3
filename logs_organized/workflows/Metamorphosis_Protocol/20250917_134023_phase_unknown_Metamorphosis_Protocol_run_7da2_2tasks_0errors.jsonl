The venture will be founded by a Keyholder with verified expert-level skills in full-stack web development (Javascript, Puppeteer, Express.js), AI integration (Python, LLMs), and deep philosophical reasoning. The mission is to achieve a minimum of $5 million in annual revenue within 3 years. The initial capital investment is strictly limited to $1000 USD, supplemented by a $50/week operational budget. The business model must evolve towards a passive or semi-passive state. Your analysis must first perform a `Knowledge Scaffolding` phase to identify high-margin, low-capital market opportunities that are uniquely suited to the founder's skill trifecta. Second, in your `Advanced Insight Generation` phase, you must use `CausalInference` to identify the primary drivers of client value in the chosen niche and `AgentBasedModeling` to simulate the most viable growth trajectory (e.g., freelance vs. SaaS vs. digital product). Finally, in your `Fused Strategy Generation` phase, synthesize all findings into a detailed, actionable, year-by-year business plan. This plan must include the initial product/service offering, a 3-year revenue model, a marketing and client acquisition strategy, and a concrete list of the first three actions to be taken within the next 24 hours."}, "result": {"result": {"generated_text": "Please provide the `knowledge_base_str` and `problem_description` strings.
