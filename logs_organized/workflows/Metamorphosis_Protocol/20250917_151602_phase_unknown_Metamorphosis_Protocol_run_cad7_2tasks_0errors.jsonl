The mission is to achieve a minimum of  million in annual revenue within 3 years. The initial capital investment is strictly limited to 000 USD, supplemented by a 0/week operational budget. The business model must evolve towards a passive or semi-passive state. Your analysis must first perform a Knowledge Scaffolding phase to identify high-margin, low-capital market opportunities that are uniquely suited to the founder's skill trifecta. Second, in your Advanced Insight Generation phase, you must use CausalInference to identify the primary drivers of client value in the chosen niche and AgentBasedModeling to simulate the most viable growth trajectory (e.g., freelance vs. SaaS vs. digital product). Finally, in your Fused Strategy Generation phase, synthesize all findings into a detailed, actionable, year-by-year business plan. This plan must include the initial product/service offering, a 3-year revenue model, a marketing and client acquisition strategy, and a concrete list of the first three actions to be taken within the next 24 hours."}, "result": {"result": {"generated_text": "Please provide the `knowledge_base_str` and `problem_description` strings.
