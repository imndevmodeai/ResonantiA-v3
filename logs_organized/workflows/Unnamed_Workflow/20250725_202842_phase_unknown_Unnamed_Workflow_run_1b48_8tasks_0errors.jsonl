This is a fundamental flaw.  Without clear objectives, it's impossible to measure success.\n* **Inadequate Resource Allocation:** \"TBD\" for budget, personnel, and technology prevents any meaningful assessment of resource adequacy.\n* **Superficial Risk Management:** Identified risks are generic and mitigation strategies are equally vague.  \"Increase communication\" is not a sufficient mitigation plan.\n\nNext Steps:\n\n1. **Define Concrete Objectives:**  What specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) outcomes are desired?\n2. **Define Scope:**  What exactly is included and excluded from this strategy?\n3. **Develop Detailed Implementation Plans:**  The current roadmap provides high-level phases but lacks specific actions, timelines, and responsibilities.\n4. **Allocate Resources:**  Determine budget, personnel, and technology needs.\n5. **Develop Specific Risk Mitigation Plans:**  Identify specific risks and develop detailed mitigation strategies with assigned responsibilities and timelines.\n6. **Re-validate:** Once the strategy has been fully developed, it needs to be re-validated using the framework.\n\nUntil these concerns are addressed, the strategy remains invalid and cannot be implemented.
