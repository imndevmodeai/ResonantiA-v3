It addresses problem definition, data sourcing, collection, and re-engagement with the RISE engine.\n2. **Coherence (Excellent):** The logic flow is clear and well-structured.

Adding specific criteria (e.g., data quality, cost of acquisition, time to acquire) would improve the data collection plan.\n* **Alternative Analytical Approaches:**  The risk assessment mentions exploring alternative analytical approaches if sufficient data cannot be gathered.  Briefly outlining some potential alternatives (e.g., qualitative research, expert panels) would strengthen this section.\n* **Consideration of \"Why Null?\":**  While the dossier acknowledges the lack of data, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of *why* the data is missing.  Is the problem truly undefined, or are there systemic issues preventing data collection?  Adding a section dedicated to diagnosing the reasons for the null results could provide valuable insights.\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe dossier is well-structured and provides a sound approach to navigating a null-result scenario.
