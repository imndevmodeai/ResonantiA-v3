Develop a hyper-specific, evidence-based product strategy for ArchE that identifies a niche category with defensible moat-building capabilities. The strategy must:

1. Analyze the current AI assistant/agent landscape to identify underserved niches
2. Identify specific moat-building opportunities (technical, data, network effects, brand)
3. Provide a detailed go-to-market plan with evidence-based validation
4. Include competitive analysis showing why this niche is defensible
5. Define specific product features that create switching costs and barriers to entry
6. Provide market sizing and validation data
7. Include a 12-month roadmap with milestones and success metrics

The analysis should be dynamically generated using real-time research, competitive intelligence, and market data. All findings must be evidence-based and vetted through multiple data sources.
