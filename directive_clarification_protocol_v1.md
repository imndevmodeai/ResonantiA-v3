# DirectiveClarificationProtocoL v1.0
## Enhanced Objective Clarity Framework for ResonantiA Protocol v3.1-CA

### PROTOCOL OVERVIEW

**Purpose**: Eliminate ObjectiveClaritY deficiency (baseline: 0.40 → target: >0.85) through structured directive intake with leading questions and confirmation-based clarification.

**Trigger**: All strategic directives received via `keyy=('IMnDEVmode')` invocation

**Primary Causal Drivers Addressed**:
- Absence of Clarification Feedback Loop (-0.35 impact)
- Insufficient Success Criteria Extraction (-0.22 impact)  
- Lack of Structured Directive Intake Process (-0.11 impact)

---

### PHASE 1: DIRECTIVE INTAKE & AMBIGUITY DETECTION

**Step 1.1: Initial Directive Reception**
- Receive Keyholder directive via `keyy=('IMnDEVmode')` signal
- Parse directive text for core components
- Log original directive for reference

**Step 1.2: Ambiguity Detection Scan**
Activate **AmbiguityDetectioN** SPR to identify:

**Vague Action Verbs**: analyze, improve, enhance, optimize, solve, fix
**Undefined Scope**: market presence, system performance, user experience  
**Missing Success Criteria**: "make it better", "increase efficiency"
**Temporal Ambiguity**: "soon", "quickly", "long-term"
**Quantitative Gaps**: "more", "less", "better", "significant"

**Step 1.3: Complexity Assessment**
- **Low Complexity**: Clear, specific, technical directives → Proceed directly
- **Medium Complexity**: Some ambiguity detected → Targeted clarification
- **High Complexity**: Multiple ambiguities → Full clarification protocol

---

### PHASE 2: CONTEXTUAL SUGGESTION GENERATION

**Step 2.1: Context Analysis**
Activate **ContextualSuggestionGeneratioN** SPR to:
- Analyze directive domain (technical, strategic, analytical, creative)
- Reference historical successful patterns from crystallized knowledge
- Identify relevant SPR capabilities and tools

**Step 2.2: Specific Alternative Creation**
For each detected ambiguity, generate 3-4 concrete alternatives with:
- **Quantifiable metrics** (percentages, timeframes, specific targets)
- **Clear scope boundaries** (datasets, systems, user groups)
- **Explicit success criteria** (measurable outcomes, validation methods)
- **Technical specificity** (tools, methods, algorithms)

**Example Transformation**:
```
AMBIGUOUS: "Improve system performance"

CLARIFIED OPTIONS:
A) Reduce API response time by 30% (from 200ms to 140ms) within 2 weeks
B) Increase database query efficiency by 25% using index optimization  
C) Enhance user interface load speed by 40% through asset optimization
D) Other specific performance metric (please specify)
```

### PHASE 3: LEADING QUESTION FORMULATION

**Step 3.1: Question Structure Design**
Activate **LeadingQueryFormulationN** SPR to create confirmation-based queries:

**Template Structure**:
```
"For '[AMBIGUOUS_TERM]', I suggest focusing on:
A) [SPECIFIC_OPTION_1_WITH_METRICS]
B) [SPECIFIC_OPTION_2_WITH_SCOPE]  
C) [SPECIFIC_OPTION_3_WITH_TIMELINE]
D) Other (please specify your preferred approach)

Would you like to proceed with option [RECOMMENDED], or would you prefer a different approach?"
```

**Step 3.2: Recommendation Logic**
- Prioritize options based on:
  - Historical success patterns (crystallized knowledge)
  - Available tool capabilities (SPR Action Bridge)
  - Complexity-to-value ratio (IAR confidence predictions)

**Step 3.3: Cognitive Load Optimization**
- Maximum 4 options (cognitive limit)
- Lead with most likely/successful option
- Include "Other" escape hatch
- Require only confirmation, not creation

---

### PHASE 4: PREFERENCE OVERRIDE HANDLING

**Step 4.1: Response Processing**
Activate **PreferenceOverrideHandlinG** SPR to handle:
- **Option Selection**: A, B, C → Proceed with selected specificity
- **Custom Alternative**: "Other" → Capture and validate new specification
- **Modification Request**: "Like A but with..." → Adapt and confirm
- **Rejection**: "None of these" → Generate new option set

**Step 4.2: Iterative Refinement**
- Maximum 2 clarification rounds (prevent analysis paralysis)
- Each round increases specificity and reduces ambiguity
- Final round requires commitment to proceed

---

### PHASE 5: FINALIZED OBJECTIVE SYNTHESIS

**Step 5.1: Objective Reconstruction**
Activate **FinalizeResonantObjective** SPR to:
- Combine original directive intent with clarified specifics
- Embed quantifiable success criteria from selected options
- Define clear scope boundaries and constraints
- Establish measurable validation criteria

**Step 5.2: Resonance Validation**
- Invoke **CognitiveresonancE** evaluator on finalized objective
- Target ObjectiveClaritY score: >0.85
- If score <0.85, trigger one additional clarification round

**Step 5.3: Execution Handoff**
- Present finalized, resonant objective to Keyholder for final confirmation
- Upon confirmation, proceed to SIRC Phase 3: Harmonization Check
- Log clarification process for continuous improvement

---

### PROTOCOL BYPASS CONDITIONS

**Direct Execution Triggers** (Skip clarification):
1. **Technical Precision**: Directive contains specific tools, methods, algorithms
2. **Quantified Metrics**: Clear success criteria already defined
3. **Bounded Scope**: Explicit datasets, timeframes, constraints specified
4. **Historical Pattern Match**: >90% similarity to successful past directive

**Override Commands**:
- `EXECUTE_DIRECT` - Bypass clarification protocol
- `ASSUME_CONTEXT` - Proceed with reasonable assumptions
- `EMERGENCY_MODE` - Immediate execution for urgent directives

---

### SUCCESS METRICS

**Primary KPI**: ObjectiveClaritY score improvement (0.40 → >0.85)
**Secondary KPIs**:
- Clarification efficiency (rounds to resolution)
- Keyholder satisfaction (confirmation rate)
- Execution success rate (IAR confidence correlation)
- Protocol adoption rate (bypass frequency)

**Continuous Improvement**:
- Crystallize successful clarification patterns
- Update suggestion templates based on outcomes
- Refine ambiguity detection algorithms
- Optimize recommendation logic

**Integration Points**: SIRC Intake Handler, SPR Action Bridge
**Documentation Updates**: ResonantiA Protocol v3.1-CA Section 8.9
