### PHASE 1: ENHANCED DIRECTIVE INTAKE & MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

**Step 1.1: Initial Directive Reception & PTRF Integration**
- Receive Keyholder directive via `keyy=('IMnDEVmode')` signal
- Parse directive text for core components using enhanced NLP capabilities
- Activate **Proactive Truth Resonance Framework** for initial verification
- Log original directive with temporal context and confidence assessment

**Step 1.2: Multi-Dimensional Ambiguity Detection**
Activate **AmbiguityDetectioN** SPR with enhanced analysis:

**Semantic Ambiguity**: Vague action verbs, undefined scope, missing context
**Temporal Ambiguity**: "soon", "quickly", "long-term", missing time horizons
**Quantitative Gaps**: "more", "less", "better", "significant" without metrics
**Technical Precision**: Missing specifications, undefined parameters
**Capability Alignment**: Mismatch with current ArchE capabilities
**Collective Intelligence Scope**: Single vs. distributed processing requirements

**Step 1.3: Enhanced Complexity Assessment**
- **Low Complexity**: Clear, specific, technical directives → Proceed directly with capability matching
- **Medium Complexity**: Some ambiguity detected → Targeted clarification with PTRF validation
- **High Complexity**: Multiple ambiguities → Full clarification protocol with collective intelligence consideration
- **Ultra Complexity**: Requires distributed processing → Activate Collective Intelligence Network

**Step 1.4: Capability Mapping & Resource Assessment**
- Map directive requirements to available ArchE capabilities
- Assess need for Enhanced Gemini Capabilities (code execution, file processing, etc.)

### PHASE 4: ENHANCED CONFIRMATION & REFINEMENT

**Step 4.1: Multi-Modal Confirmation**
- **Selection Confirmation**: "Which option best captures your intent?"
- **Capability Confirmation**: "Should this leverage [specific ArchE capabilities]?"
- **Temporal Confirmation**: "What is the appropriate time horizon for analysis?"
- **Collective Confirmation**: "Should this be distributed across the intelligence network?"
- **Validation Confirmation**: "What level of real-world validation is required?"

**Step 4.2: Iterative Refinement with Enhanced Intelligence**
- Maximum 2 clarification rounds (prevent analysis paralysis)
- Each round increases specificity and reduces ambiguity
- Apply PTRF validation at each iteration
- Consider collective intelligence input for complex refinements
- Final round requires commitment to proceed with capability allocation

- Target ObjectiveClaritY score: >0.85
- If score <0.85, trigger one additional clarification round with enhanced analysis

**Step 5.3: Enhanced Execution Handoff**
- Present finalized, resonant objective to Keyholder for final confirmation
- Include capability activation plan and resource allocation
- Specify collective intelligence coordination requirements
- Upon confirmation, proceed to SIRC Phase 3: Harmonization Check
