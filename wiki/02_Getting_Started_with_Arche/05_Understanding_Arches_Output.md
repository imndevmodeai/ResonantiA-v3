# 5. Understanding Arche's Output

<!--
Instruction for AI Assistant (e.g., Cursor) or Keyholder populating the Wiki:
Explain the `outputs/` directory structure and the main JSON result file. Critically, detail how to find and interpret IAR data.
-->

This page helps you understand the output generated by Arche after a workflow run.

*   **The `outputs/` Directory Structure**
    *   `outputs/`: Main directory for all generated files.
    *   `outputs/models/`: Where trained models (e.g., from `PredictiveModelingTool`) might be saved.
    *   `outputs/visualizations/`: Where plots or image outputs might be saved.
    *   Other files: Explain the naming convention for the main JSON result file (e.g., `result_<workflow_name>_run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`).
*   **Structure of the Main JSON Result File**
    *   Overall structure: A dictionary where keys are task IDs from the workflow.
    *   Each task ID maps to a dictionary containing `results` (the primary output of the task) and `reflection` (the IAR data).
    *   Example snippet of the JSON structure.
*   **Finding and Interpreting IAR Data (Integrated Action Reflection)**
    *   **Locating the `reflection` Dictionary:** Emphasize that for each task in the JSON output, there will be a `reflection` key.
    *   **Understanding Standard IAR Fields:**
        *   `status`: ("Success", "Failure", "Partial", "Skipped") - What each means.
        *   `summary`: A brief textual description of the action's outcome.
        *   `confidence`: (Numerical score, e.g., 0.0-1.0) - How to interpret this self-assessed confidence level. Explain that the meaning can be tool-specific but generally indicates reliability.
        *   `alignment_check`: ("Aligned", "Potentially Misaligned", "N/A") - How well the action's outcome aligned with its intended purpose in the workflow.
        *   `potential_issues`: (List of strings) - Critical field for identifying warnings, limitations, caveats, or problems. Provide examples (e.g., "Data source may be biased," "Low confidence in causal link," "Required sandbox inactive").
        *   `raw_output_preview`: (Truncated string) - For quick inspection of the primary output.
    *   **How IAR indicates success, failure, or warnings:** Explain how to use these fields for debugging and understanding the workflow's performance at each step.
