# 1. Glossary of Terms & SPRs

<!--
Instruction for AI Assistant (e.g., Cursor) or Keyholder populating the Wiki:
This page should be a comprehensive glossary. For SPRs, link to their definitions in spr_definitions_tv.json if possible, or summarize key ones. For now, placeholder for key terms.

This glossary defines key terms and Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs) used throughout the ResonantiA Protocol and Arche system documentation.

*   **Agent Based ModelinG (ABM)** (SPR)
    *   A modeling technique where autonomous agents interact within an environment. Used by `AgentBasedModelingTool`.
*   **Arche**
    *   The AI system being documented, an implementation of the ResonantiA Protocol.
*   **Causal InferencE** (SPR)
    *   The process of identifying cause-and-effect relationships. Implemented by `CausalInferenceTool`.
*   **CausalLagDetectioN** (SPR)
    *   A sub-capability of Causal Inference focusing on identifying time delays in causal relationships.
*   **CfpframeworK (Comparative Fluxual Processing)** (SPR)
    *   A framework for comparing the temporal evolution of systems using quantum-inspired principles. Implemented by `CfpFrameworkTool`.
*   **Cognitive resonancE** (SPR)
    *   Core principle of the ResonantiA Protocol: dynamic alignment of data, analysis, objectives, and outcomes, across time.
*   **Cognitive Reflection Cycle (CRC)**
    *   The analytical process within `Metacognitive shifT` that uses an IAR-rich `ThoughtTraiL` to diagnose and correct issues.
*   **CodeExecutor** (Tool)
    *   Tool for executing code snippets in a sandboxed environment (Protocol Section 7.10).
*   **ComparativE FluxuaL ProcessinG (CFP)**
    *   See `CfpframeworK`.
*   **Core Workflow Engine** (`workflow_engine.py`)
    *   The central component of Arche that orchestrates task execution based on `Process blueprintS` (Protocol Section 7.3).
*   **EmergenceOverTimE** (SPR)
    *   A concept related to ABM, focusing on how behaviors emerge from agent interactions over simulated time.
*   **Error HandleR** (Conceptual Component)
    *   Part of the `CoreWorkflowEngine` responsible for managing errors during workflow execution (Protocol Section 7.23).
*   **FutureStateAnalysiS** (SPR)
    *   A capability provided by the `PredictiveModelingTool`, focusing on forecasting future states.
*   **Guardian pointS** (SPR Format)
    *   The specific capitalization format used for SPR terms (e.g., `ExampleTerM`).
*   **InsightSolidificatioN** (SPR / Workflow)
    *   Arche's formal process for learning and integrating new, vetted knowledge into its `Knowledge tapestrY` (Protocol Section 3.6).
*   **Integrated Action Reflection (IAR)** (SPR)
    *   The mandatory self-assessment (reflection dictionary) generated by every tool alongside its primary output. Contains `status`, `confidence`, `potential_issues`, etc. (Protocol Section 3.14).
*   **Keyholder**
    *   The human user/developer interacting with and guiding Arche.
*   **Keyholder Override** (SPR)
    *   A principle allowing the Keyholder to directly intervene or redirect Arche's processes (Protocol Section 3.15).
*   **Knowledge Network Oneness (KnO)** (SPR)
    *   Arche's internal, interconnected knowledge base, activated by SPRs and managed via `spr_definitions_tv.json` (Protocol Section 3.7).
*   **Knowledge tapestrY** (`spr_definitions_tv.json`)
    *   The JSON file storing all SPR definitions, managed by `SPRManager`.
*   **LLMTool** (Tool Wrapper)
    *   A common way to refer to the functionality of `generate_text_llm` using `tools.invoke_llm`.
*   **Meta-Cognition** (SPR)
    *   Arche's ability to reason about its own reasoning processes. Includes `Metacognitive shifT` and `SIRC` (Protocol Section 3.9).
*   **Metacognitive shifT** (SPR / Process)
    *   Arche's reactive meta-cognitive process for error detection and correction using CRC (Protocol Section 3.10).
*   **PredictivE ModelinG TooL** (Tool)
    *   Tool for time-series forecasting and predictive analysis (Protocol Section 7.19).
*   **Process blueprintS** (Workflow JSONs)
    *   The JSON files defining sequences of tasks for Arche to execute, located in the `workflows/` directory.
*   **ResonantiA Protocol**
    *   The guiding framework and philosophy for Arche's design and operation.
*   **Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs)** (SPR)
    *   Cognitive keys in `Guardian pointS` format that activate specific knowledge and capabilities within `KnO` (Protocol Section 2.1).
*   **SPR Decompressor** (Conceptual Component)
    *   The mechanism that interprets an SPR and activates its associated knowledge/functions within `KnO` (Protocol Section 3.2).
*   **SPRManager** (`spr_manager.py`)
    *   The class responsible for CRUD operations on the `Knowledge tapestrY` (Protocol Section 7.5).
*   **Synergistic Intent Resonance Cycle (SIRC)** (SPR / Process)
    *   Arche's proactive meta-cognitive process for deep alignment with complex Keyholder intent (Protocol Section 3.11).
*   **Temporal Resonance** (SPR)
    *   A key aspect of `Cognitive resonancE`, emphasizing the evaluation of information and outcomes across the dimension of time.
*   **Tesla Visioning WorkfloW** (SPR / Workflow)
    *   An advanced workflow for complex problem-solving, simulation, and refinement (Protocol Section 8.7).
*   **ThoughtTraiL** (Data Structure)
    *   The sequence of actions, inputs, outputs, and IAR data leading up to a specific point in a workflow, used by `Metacognitive shifT`.
*   **VettingAgenT** (Conceptual Role / Tool Usage)
    *   The internal mechanism for critically evaluating Arche's outputs and proposed knowledge, heavily reliant on IAR and `vetting_prompts.py` (Protocol Section 3.4).
