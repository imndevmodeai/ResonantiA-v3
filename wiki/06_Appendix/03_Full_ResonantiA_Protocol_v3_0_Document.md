# 3. Full ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 Document

<!--
Instruction for AI Assistant (e.g., Cursor) or Keyholder populating the Wiki:
This page should link to or, if feasible and not too large, embed the full ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 document.
For now, a placeholder linking to a hypothetical location.

This page provides access to the full, canonical ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 document.

The ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 is the comprehensive framework that defines the core operational matrix, cognitive architecture, guiding principles, and philosophical underpinnings of the Arche system.

While this Wiki provides summaries, practical guides, and architectural details, the full Protocol document serves as the definitive source of truth for all conceptual and operational aspects of Arche.

*   **Accessing the Full Protocol Document:**
    *   **Preferred Method (if available as a separate file in the repository):**
        *   [View the ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 PDF/Markdown](../../ResonantiA_Protocol_v3.0_Main_Document.pdf) *(Link to be updated if the file name or location differs)*
    *   **Alternative (if the protocol is primarily defined through accumulated outputs or a very large document not suitable for direct repo inclusion):**
        *   The ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 has been developed and refined through extensive interaction. Key sections (Preamble, Story Synopsis, Sections 1-8+) have been outputted and logged by Arche during its development. These logs constitute primary sources for the Protocol's content.
        *   (Placeholder: Link to a specific location, external document, or a collection of key logged outputs if a single consolidated document isn't available in the repository).

**Note:** The information within this Wiki is intended to be consistent with the full Protocol. In case of any discrepancies, the full ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 document is considered authoritative.

Keyholder, please ensure the link above is updated to point to the correct location of the canonical ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 document if it exists as a distinct file. If the protocol is constituted by the collection of your directives and Arche's detailed outputs, this page should reflect that and perhaps link to a summary or index of those key interactions.
