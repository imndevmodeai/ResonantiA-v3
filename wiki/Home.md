# ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 & Arche Project Wiki

Instruction for AI Assistant (e.g., Cursor) or Keyholder populating the Wiki:
This introductory text should be placed on the Wiki's main/home page or as a preface to the Wiki section.
It sets the stage for the entire documentation effort.

The project Wiki serves as an essential, dynamic, and user-centric knowledge base complementing the formal ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 document. Hosted directly within the repository platform (GitHub Wiki, Hugging Face Hub Community Tab/Wiki features, or a dedicated documentation site), its primary objectives are:

*   **Accessibility**: Provide a high-level, easily navigable overview of the ResonantiA philosophy, core v3.0 concepts (Cognitive resonancE, IAR, 4D Thinking, SPRs, Meta-Cognition, Keyholder Override), and the Arche implementation for new users, developers, or stakeholders.
*   **Practical Guidance**: Offer clear, actionable guides for environment setup (Section 4), configuration (config.py, secure API key handling), running basic and advanced workflows (including temporal ones like those in Sections 7.30-7.32), interpreting IAR data (status codes, confidence levels, potential issues), and troubleshooting common issues.
*   **Architectural Elaboration**: Document the system's architecture, design patterns, data flows (especially context and IAR propagation within the Core Workflow Engine), tool integration requirements (including the mandatory IAR implementation for all actions), and the rationale behind specific v3.0 design choices in greater detail than feasible within code comments or the protocol document itself.
*   **Development Roadmap & Contribution**: Outline future development plans, track progress on tool implementations (e.g., advanced causal discovery, ODE solvers for CFP), define coding standards, detail the process for contributing (issues, pull requests, emphasizing IAR compliance and testing), and foster a collaborative development environment (even if initially just for the Keyholder).
*   **Living Knowledge Base**: Act as a central, up-to-date repository for usage examples, best practices, FAQs, and evolving understanding of the framework, allowing for more frequent updates than formal protocol version releases. This includes documenting insights gained from applying Metacognitive shifT or SIRC.

## Latest Updates (v3.0 - "Temporal Resonance & IAR")

* **Integrated Action Reflection (IAR)**: Mandatory implementation across all tools with standardized reflection dictionary
* **Temporal Resonance & 4D Thinking**: New capabilities for analyzing system evolution over time
* **Enhanced Tools**: Functional implementations of PredictivE ModelinG TooL, CausalInferenceTool, and AgentBasedModelingTool
* **New Workflows**: Added temporal forecasting, causal analysis, and comparative future scenario workflows
* **System Representation**: Enhanced with timestamp-based history tracking for temporal analysis
* **Resonance Tracking**: New ResonanceTracker for monitoring tactical resonance and crystallization metrics
