## 🔬 Predictive Flux Coupling (PFC) - Technical Analysis

### Mathematical Foundation

**Formal Definition:**
```
PFC_{A→B}(δ, W, T) = max(0, C_AB(δ, W, T)) * I_AB(δ, W, T)
```

Where:
- `C_AB(δ, W, T)` = Time-lagged cross-correlation component
- `I_AB(δ, W, T)` = Normalized information flow component (Transfer Entropy approximation)
- `δ` = Time lag (prediction horizon)
- `W` = Window size
- `T` = Time endpoint

### Implementation Architecture

#### 1. **Core PFC Engine** (`PredictiveFluxCouplingEngine`)

**Key Features:**
- **Lagged Correlation Analysis**: Implements robust Pearson correlation with time lag
- **Transfer Entropy Approximation**: Uses mutual information for practical TE calculation
- **Signal Discretization**: Quantile-based binning for robust MI estimation
- **Confidence Assessment**: Multi-factor confidence scoring
- **IAR Integration**: Mandatory Integrated Action Reflection for self-awareness

**Code Structure:**
```python
class PredictiveFluxCouplingEngine:
    def calculate_pfc_metric(self, flux_a, flux_b, delta=1, window_size=20):
        # 1. Input validation and preprocessing
        # 2. Lagged correlation calculation
        # 3. Transfer entropy approximation
        # 4. PFC score combination
        # 5. Confidence assessment and IAR generation
```

#### 2. **Correlation Component** (`_calculate_lagged_correlation`)

**Implementation Details:**
- Handles variable window sizes with boundary conditions
- Uses SciPy's `pearsonr` when available, falls back to NumPy
- Robust NaN handling and edge case management
- Time lag validation against data length

**Mathematical Implementation:**
```python
correlation = pearsonr(flux_a[start:end], flux_b[start+delta:end+delta])
```

#### 3. **Information Flow Component** (`_calculate_transfer_entropy`)

**Transfer Entropy Approximation:**
```
TE ≈ MI(F_B(t+δ), F_A(t)) - MI(F_B(t+δ), F_B(t))
```

**Key Features:**
- Mutual information estimation using sklearn
- Signal discretization with quantile-based binning
- Normalization by target entropy
- Fallback correlation-based estimation

### Validation Results

**Test Scenario:** Two coupled time series with known lag=3, coupling_strength=0.8

**Results:**
```
Lag δ=1: PFC=0.0048, Corr=0.2298, Info=0.0209
Lag δ=2: PFC=0.0129, Corr=0.3096, Info=0.0417
Lag δ=3: PFC=0.0302, Corr=0.7246, Info=0.0417  ← OPTIMAL (TRUE LAG)
Lag δ=4: PFC=0.0105, Corr=0.5029, Info=0.0209
```

**Key Validation Points:**
- ✅ **Optimal lag detection**: Algorithm correctly identified δ=3 as optimal
- ✅ **Correlation peak**: Highest correlation at true lag (0.7246)
- ✅ **PFC scoring**: Combined metric properly weighted correlation and information flow
- ✅ **Confidence assessment**: Realistic confidence scores (0.455-0.514 range)

## 🎯 Comparative Ensemble Forecasting (CEF) - Architecture

### Conceptual Framework

CEF dynamically weights forecasting models based on their historical performance during specific comparative patterns detected by the PatternAnalyzer.

**Core Algorithm:**
1. **Pattern Detection**: Identify active comparative patterns
2. **Contextual Weighting**: Calculate performance-based model weights
3. **Base Forecasting**: Generate forecasts from multiple models
4. **Ensemble Combination**: Weight and combine base forecasts
5. **Confidence Estimation**: Calculate ensemble confidence intervals

### Implementation Components

#### 1. **Comparative Pattern Analyzer**

**Pattern Definitions:**
```python
pattern_definitions = {
    "high_flux_divergence": lambda ctx: ctx.get("flux_divergence", 0) > 0.5,
    "strong_pfc_coupling": lambda ctx: ctx.get("pfc_score", 0) > 0.7,
    "temporal_instability": lambda ctx: ctx.get("volatility", 0) > 0.3,
    "convergence_pattern": lambda ctx: ctx.get("convergence_detected", False),
    "oscillatory_behavior": lambda ctx: ctx.get("oscillating", False)
}
```

**Context Enhancement:**
- Volatility calculation from returns
- Oscillation detection via peak counting
- Convergence detection through variance analysis

#### 2. **Model Registry & Weighting**

**Weight Calculation:**
```python
model_score = 1.0 / (1.0 + avg_historical_error)
normalized_weight = model_score / total_score
```

**Base Model Support:**
- ARIMA models for trend/seasonality
- Prophet for automatic seasonality detection
- Linear trend models
- Custom callable models

#### 3. **Ensemble Combination**

**Weighted Forecast:**
```python
combined_forecast = sum(weight * forecast for weight, forecast in zip(weights, forecasts))
```

**Confidence Intervals:**
```python
confidence_interval = ensemble_value ± 1.96 * weighted_std
```

pfc_result = run_predictive_flux_analysis(
    operation="calculate_pfc",
    flux_a=flux_a,
    flux_b=flux_b,
    delta=1
)
```

### 3. **IAR Compliance & Self-Awareness**
