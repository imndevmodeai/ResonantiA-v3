## COMPLETE ENHANCED OBJECTIVE TEXT

```
Apply the full spectrum of ResonantiA Protocol v3.5-GP (Genesis Protocol) capabilities to achieve deep Temporal Resonance and Cognitive Resonance on this historical matchup question. Execute a temporally-aware, multi-dimensional analytical sequence that integrates: HistoricalContextualizatioN (understanding both eras), TemporalDynamiX modeling (how the fight evolves round-by-round), FutureStateAnalysiS (predicting outcomes across time horizons), CausalLagDetectioN (identifying time-delayed effects of fighting strategies), EmergenceOverTimE simulation (ABM showing how agent interactions create unpredictable outcomes), and TrajectoryComparisoN (CFP comparing fight trajectory probabilities). This analysis must honor Mandate 6 (Temporal Resonance) and Mandate 9 (Complex System Visioning) while maintaining Implementation Resonance throughout.

## AGE INFORMATION TRACING

### QUESTION: Where did "age 20-22" and "age 24-25" come from?

**Answer**: They came from the **original user query** - they were NOT extracted or calculated.

**Evidence from Run Event**:
- The QueryText section shows: "Mike Tyson in his prime (circa 1986-1988, **age 20-22**)"  
- The QueryText section shows: "George Foreman in his prime (circa 1973-1974, **age 24-25**)"  
- These ages appear **exactly as provided in the original user query**

**Construction Path**:
1. User provides query with ages already specified
2. Query preprocessing preserves ages in QueryText
3. Ages are passed through to TemporalScope extraction
4. TemporalScope captures: "Explicit: Historical primes (1986-1988 vs 1973-1974)"
5. Ages are preserved in the enriched problem_description string
6. Ages appear in workflow task prompts via `{{ problem_description }}`

**NOT Calculated**: No code found that:
- Calculates age from birth date and time period
- Extracts age from external databases
- Uses LLM to infer ages from dates

**Conclusion**: The ages were **user-provided** in the original query and passed through the system unchanged.

## CONSTRUCTION MECHANISM SUMMARY

### Step-by-Step Construction Process:

1. **Query Intake**
   - User query received: "Who would win... (circa 1986-1988, age 20-22)... (circa 1973-1974, age 24-25)?"
   - Ages already present in query

2. **TemporalScope Extraction**
   - Pattern matching extracts: "1986-1988", "1973-1974"
   - Ages preserved: "age 20-22", "age 24-25"
   - Creates TemporalScope structure

3. **SPR Detection**
   - Scans query for SPR keywords: "historical", "emergent", "causal", "predictive"
   - Matches to SPR definitions in `spr_definitions_tv.json`
   - Activates relevant SPRs

4. **Capability Matching**
   - Historical → HistoricalContextualizatioN
   - Temporal/evolution → TemporalDynamiX
   - Predictive → FutureStateAnalysiS
   - Causal → CausalLagDetectioN
   - Emergent → EmergenceOverTimE
   - Comparison → TrajectoryComparisoN

5. **Mandate Matching**
   - Temporal elements → Mandate 6
   - Complex/emergent → Mandate 9

6. **Template Assembly**
   - Base template: Enhancement_Skeleton_Pattern (Section 8.2)
   - Fill protocol version: "v3.5-GP (Genesis Protocol)"
   - Insert capabilities: List of matched SPRs
   - Add mandate references: Based on query characteristics
   - Customize explanations: Domain-specific (boxing/fight context)

7. **Objective Text Generation**
   - Assemble from template + matched components
   - Add parenthetical explanations based on query context
   - Ensure Guardian pointS format for SPR names

8. **Injection into Workflow**
   - Wrapped in Enhancement_Skeleton_Pattern structure
   - Embedded in problem_description
   - Passed to workflow tasks

---

## KEY FINDINGS

1. **Ages**: Provided by user, NOT calculated or extracted
2. **Objective Structure**: Template-based with intelligent capability selection
3. **SPR Selection**: Based on keyword matching and query characteristics
4. **Mandate References**: Determined by query type (temporal → Mandate 6, complex → Mandate 9)
5. **Domain Customization**: Parenthetical explanations adapt to query domain (boxing)
6. **No LLM Generation**: Objective is template-assembled, not LLM-generated
