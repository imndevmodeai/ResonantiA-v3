The extraction uses meta-conceptual patterns: CAUSE_ROLE_PATTERNS (identify agents, drivers, interventions), EFFECT_ROLE_PATTERNS (identify targets, results, consequences), SVO_PATTERNS (Subject-Verb-Object where Subject=CAUSE, Object=EFFECT), and transformation patterns ('from X to Y'). UNIVERSAL ABSTRACTION: No LLM dependencies - all extraction uses deterministic pattern matching, rule-based entity extraction, and structural analysis. The convenience function extract_causal_parameters() automatically selects the appropriate method based on available inputs. Supports multiple strategies: 'auto' (deterministic rule-based selection), 'pattern' (meta-conceptual regex-based), and 'hybrid' (multiple pattern strategies combined). Returns semantic role metadata (cause_role_type: AGENT|DRIVER|INTERVENTION|SOURCE, effect_role_type: PATIENT|RESULT|TARGET|CONSEQUENCE) with quantum probability confidence states.",

This phenomenon makes visible the normally hidden dynamics operating in relationship systems.
