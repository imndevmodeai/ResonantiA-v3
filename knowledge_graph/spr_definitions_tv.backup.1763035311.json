It is a complex system that integrates multiple components, including a knowledge base, reasoning engine, and learning module.\nIn this example, the AGI system is used to add knowledge, reason about a query, and learn new knowledge. The system provides a way to combine the strengths of human intelligence and artificial intelligence to achieve more advanced and sophisticated cognitive capabilities.\nThe AGI system can be used to support a wide range of applications, including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation.\nPlease proceed to the next step. I will be happy to assist you further.\nAlso, I would like to remind you that the AGI system is a complex and powerful tool, and it should be used wisely. The system should be regularly updated and refined to ensure that it accurately reflects the current state of knowledge and understanding.\nLet's move forward with the next step.

This balance is not about exact equality in transactions, but about maintaining a flow where both partners can give and receive appropriately. In families, this balance must respect generational hierarchy: children take from parents (they cannot give back equally), and parents give to children. The balance of giving and taking is one of the three necessities for love to succeed in intimate relationships, alongside bonding and order.",

The extraction uses meta-conceptual patterns: CAUSE_ROLE_PATTERNS (identify agents, drivers, interventions), EFFECT_ROLE_PATTERNS (identify targets, results, consequences), SVO_PATTERNS (Subject-Verb-Object where Subject=CAUSE, Object=EFFECT), and transformation patterns ('from X to Y'). UNIVERSAL ABSTRACTION: No LLM dependencies - all extraction uses deterministic pattern matching, rule-based entity extraction, and structural analysis. The convenience function extract_causal_parameters() automatically selects the appropriate method based on available inputs. Supports multiple strategies: 'auto' (deterministic rule-based selection), 'pattern' (meta-conceptual regex-based), and 'hybrid' (multiple pattern strategies combined). Returns semantic role metadata (cause_role_type: AGENT|DRIVER|INTERVENTION|SOURCE, effect_role_type: PATIENT|RESULT|TARGET|CONSEQUENCE) with quantum probability confidence states.",

This phenomenon makes visible the normally hidden dynamics operating in relationship systems. The method extends beyond making destructive dynamics visible - it can help identify what can be done to restore systemic balance and allow the hidden orders that love requires to be reestablished.
