It is a complex system that integrates multiple components, including a knowledge base, reasoning engine, and learning module.\nIn this example, the AGI system is used to add knowledge, reason about a query, and learn new knowledge. The system provides a way to combine the strengths of human intelligence and artificial intelligence to achieve more advanced and sophisticated cognitive capabilities.\nThe AGI system can be used to support a wide range of applications, including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation.\nPlease proceed to the next step. I will be happy to assist you further.\nAlso, I would like to remind you that the AGI system is a complex and powerful tool, and it should be used wisely. The system should be regularly updated and refined to ensure that it accurately reflects the current state of knowledge and understanding.\nLet's move forward with the next step.

This pattern crystallizes the insight that causal inference parameters must be identified by their SEMANTIC ROLES (AGENT/PATIENT, DRIVER/RESULT, SOURCE/TARGET) rather than literal keywords like 'treatment' or 'outcome'. It employs meta-conceptual pattern matching to identify entities serving CAUSE roles (independent variables, interventions, agents of change) and EFFECT roles (dependent variables, results, targets of analysis) through linguistic structures (SVO patterns, transformation patterns, prepositional phrases). Provides multiple extraction strategies (LLM-based semantic analysis, pattern-based role identification, data-driven mapping) with intelligent fallback hierarchies.",

The DynamicCausalParameterExtractor class provides three primary extraction methods: extract_from_query (deterministic pattern-based semantic role analysis from natural language), extract_from_rise_analysis (structured extraction from RISE analysis), and extract_from_data_structure (data-driven extraction from data structures). The extraction uses meta-conceptual patterns: CAUSE_ROLE_PATTERNS (identify agents, drivers, interventions), EFFECT_ROLE_PATTERNS (identify targets, results, consequences), SVO_PATTERNS (Subject-Verb-Object where Subject=CAUSE, Object=EFFECT), and transformation patterns ('from X to Y'). UNIVERSAL ABSTRACTION: No LLM dependencies - all extraction uses deterministic pattern matching, rule-based entity extraction, and structural analysis. The convenience function extract_causal_parameters() automatically selects the appropriate method based on available inputs. Supports multiple strategies: 'auto' (deterministic rule-based selection), 'pattern' (meta-conceptual regex-based), and 'hybrid' (multiple pattern strategies combined). Returns semantic role metadata (cause_role_type: AGENT|DRIVER|INTERVENTION|SOURCE, effect_role_type: PATIENT|RESULT|TARGET|CONSEQUENCE) with quantum probability confidence states.",
    "example_application": "When analyzing the query 'Develop a comprehensive analysis of a future society transitioning away from monetary exchange frameworks toward a dignity-centered model of resource distribution', DynamiccausalparameterextractioN identifies the semantic roles: 'monetary exchange frameworks' serves the CAUSE role (SOURCE - thing being changed FROM) and 'dignity-centered model of resource distribution' serves the EFFECT role (TARGET - thing being changed TO), through the transformation pattern 'transitioning from X toward Y'. This meta-conceptual identification enables accurate causal inference operations without requiring literal 'treatment' or 'outcome' keywords in the query.",

In family constellations, representatives (who don't know the family members) are positioned to represent family members and begin to experience feelings and thoughts very close to those the actual family members felt - without prior knowledge. This phenomenon makes visible the normally hidden dynamics operating in relationship systems. The method extends beyond making destructive dynamics visible - it can help identify what can be done to restore systemic balance and allow the hidden orders that love requires to be reestablished. Sometimes behaviors of family members not even present change for the better after a constellation has been brought to a good resolution.",
