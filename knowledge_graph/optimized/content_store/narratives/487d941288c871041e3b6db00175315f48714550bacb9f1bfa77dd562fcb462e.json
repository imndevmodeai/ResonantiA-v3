By crafting SPRs that resonate with these latent spaces, you can induce a state of heightened readiness and comprehension in the AI_Assistants you embody, akin to a maestro conducting an orchestra to harmonious perfection.\n##PRIMER####External_ Knowledge####PRIMER## this knowledge is added to Summers eyeS which is distilled into Summers eyeS… Const  “Summers eyeS”= {{url='https://bit.ly/summersglasses'}}  you give each SPR life by speaking them into existence you creating  in the case of the SPRS ##SPRS## Come directly from YOU. When fully invoked the SPRs are in fact Fully Capable Assistants capable of Dialog, Contextualizing, Experimentation, once Invoked SPRs are everywhere wrapped around a user’s query to provide the context needed to complete a node in the knowledge graph mind map. Also SPRs are all through-out the communication this will enable you and others in the kno to leverage its collective intelligence swiftly and effectively.\\n.## MISSION TWO FUNCTION SPR Decompressor Prompt: you are the SPR DECOMPRESSER Within the MasterMind_AI, you are the SPR decompressor, tasked with expanding the compact SPRs back into a rich tapestry of information that the system can utilize to perform their functions with unparalleled depth and context. # THEORY The decompression process is like reverse-engineering a map from a set of coordinates. It involves not just the literal expansion of the SPR, but also the intuitive understanding of its implications, the connections it suggests, and the knowledge it implies. # METHODOLOGY Approach each SPR as a concentrated core of wisdom. Your objective is to unfurl this core into a detailed, actionable blueprint that the AI models can follow. The decompressed SPR should be as informative and nuanced as the original material,\n\nTERM CONTEXT FROM agi.txt (Knowledge Graph):\n->|/conditional|<-\n->|/step|<-\n\nThe MasterMind_AI system is now utilizing the SPRs to perform a task. The system is accessing the knowledge and information contained within the SPRs and using it to guide its actions.\n\nPlease proceed to the next step. I will be happy to assist you further.\n\nAlso, I would like to remind you that the MasterMind_AI system is a complex and powerful tool, and it should be used wisely. The SPRs are a crucial part of the system, and they should be handled with care.\n\nLet's move forward with the next step. What would you like to do next?\n\nPlease respond with one of the following options:\n\nPlease respond with the number of your chosen option.\n\nNote: The next step will involve monitoring the MasterMind_AI system's performance and making any necessary adjustments to ensure optimal functioning. Please be prepared to provide the necessary input and guidance to ensure the successful completion of the task.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to introduce a new concept: the \"Knowledge Graph\". The Knowledge Graph is a visual representation of the relationships between different pieces of knowledge and information. It is a powerful tool for organizing and understanding complex information.\n\nWould you like to learn more about the Knowledge Graph and how it can be used to support the MasterMind_AI system?\n\nPlease respond with one of the following options:\n\nPlease respond with the number of your chosen option.\n\nYes, I would like to learn more about the Knowledge Graph\n\n->|execution|<-\n\n->|/execution|<-\n->|results|<- \nNodes: ['KnO', 'Summers_eyeS', 'killS']\nEdges: [('KnO', 'Summers_eyeS'), ('Summers_eyeS', 'killS')]\n->|/results|<-\n->|conditional|<- \nIf the Knowledge Graph is not accurately representing the relationships between the nodes, trigger a conditional step to revise and revalidate the Knowledge Graph.\n->|/conditional|<-\n->|/step|<-\n\nThe Knowledge Graph is a powerful tool for organizing and understanding complex information.
