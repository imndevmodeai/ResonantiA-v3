{"content": "TERM: Error Recovery Protocol\n\nDEFINITION:\nA systematic framework for detecting, analyzing, recovering from, and preventing errors in ArchE operations. Implements proactive error detection, graceful degradation, automatic recovery mechanisms, and learning from error patterns to prevent future occurrences.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nCrystallized from comprehensive error pattern analysis across 63 sessions. Addresses the critical need for systematic error handling and recovery mechanisms.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nWhen a terminal command fails, automatically attempt alternative approaches, log the error pattern, and update recovery strategies for future similar situations.\n\nCATEGORY: LearnedWisdom\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: AutopoieticInsight; confidence: 0.95; occurrences: 53122; success_rate: 0.3; context: Analysis of 53,122+ error occurrences across 63 sessions reveals need for systematic error handling; recommendation: Implement comprehensive error recovery protocol with proactive detection and automatic recovery; guardian_approved: True; crystallization_date: 2025-10-16T06:10:14.813077; enables: ProactiveErrorDetection, GracefulDegradation, AutomaticRecovery, ErrorPatternLearning, PreventiveMeasures; supports_principle: SystemReliability, AutonomousOperation, ContinuousImprovement"}
