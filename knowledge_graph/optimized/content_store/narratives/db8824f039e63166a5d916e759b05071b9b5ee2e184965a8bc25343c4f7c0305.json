{"content": "TERM: Cognitive Tools\n\nDEFINITION:\nThe suite of specialized functions and modules that ArchE can invoke to perform specific tasks such as code execution, web search, causal inference, predictive modeling, and agent-based simulation. All tools are mandated to return an IAR alongside their primary output.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSee ResonantiA Protocol v3.0, Section 7.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nPractical application of Cognitive Tools within the ResonantiA Protocol framework\n\nCATEGORY: SystemComponent\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: CapabilitySet; includes: Code executoR, Search tooL, PredictivE modelinG tooL, CausalInferenceTool, AgentBasedModelingTool, CfpframeworK, LlmTooL; invoked_by: CoreworkflowenginE; must_produce: IAR; confidence: high"}
