{"content": "TERM: Ambiguity Detection\n\nDEFINITION:\nA cognitive scanning capability that systematically identifies vague action verbs, undefined scope, missing success criteria, temporal ambiguity, and quantitative gaps within strategic directives to trigger appropriate clarification protocols.\n\n[From agi.txt]: Finally, we can integrate a Robotics module to enable the system to interact with the physical world. This will enable the system to perform tasks such as object manipulation, navigation, and human-robot interaction.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nStandard implementation blueprint for AmbiguitydetectioN\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nDetects 'improve market presence' contains vague action verb 'improve' and undefined scope 'market presence', triggering clarification with specific alternatives like geographic expansion or engagement metrics.\n\nCATEGORY: AnalyticalTechnique\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: DetectionMechanism; part_of: ObjectiveClarificationProtocoL; identifies: VagueActionVerbs, UndefinedScope, MissingSuccessCriteria, TemporalAmbiguity, QuantitativeGaps; triggers: ContextualSuggestionGeneratioN; informed_by: PROJECT_CHIMERA_causal_analysis; confidence: high\n\nCONTEXT TYPE: Conversation-derived knowledge (no direct spec/code, enriched from agi.txt conversations)\n\nIMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE: This SPR represents knowledge understood through conversation context and osmosis"}
