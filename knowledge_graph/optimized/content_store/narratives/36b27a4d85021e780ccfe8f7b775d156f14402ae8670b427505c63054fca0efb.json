This system transforms scattered knowledge fragments into a coherent, navigable, and infinitely rich network of understanding.\n\nThe Knowledge Graph Manager serves as the central repository for ArchE's knowledge, managing both individual Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs) and the dynamic relationships that connect them into a living tapestry of meaning. It ensures that knowledge is not just stored but actively organized, connected, and made accessible for discovery and insight generation.\n\n## Current Architecture (v3.5-GP)\n\n**Tapestry Structure**:\n- **202 SPR nodes** across **65 knowledge categories**\n- **67 relationship edges** linking concepts\n- **Graph density**: Strategic sparse connectivity (0.0033)\n- **Primary storage**: `knowledge_graph/spr_definitions_tv.json`\n\n**Relationship Types** (9 primary):\n1. `requires` - Dependency relationships\n2. `implements` - Implementation mappings\n3. `part_of` - Compositional hierarchies\n4. `prime` - Priming/activation chains\n5. `enabled_by` - Capability enablement\n6. `used_by` - Usage relationships\n7. `related_to` - General associations\n8. `inform` - Information flow\n9. `monitor` - Observational connections\n\n**Top Interconnected SPRs** (Hub Analysis):\n- **FourdthinkinG** - Temporal reasoning capabilities\n- **AdaptivecognitiveorchestratoR (ACO)** - Fast-response cognitive routing\n- **WorkflowEnginE** - Process orchestration\n- **KnO** - Knowledge structure itself\n- **IAR** - Integrated Action Reflection\n\n## Part I: The Philosophical Mandate (The \"Why\")\n\nIn the vast expanse of ArchE's cognitive universe, there must be a keeper of memories, a guardian of knowledge, a curator of wisdom. The **Knowledge Graph Manager** is ArchE's memory keeper, the system that maintains the intricate web of relationships between concepts, preserves the accumulated wisdom of countless interactions, and provides the foundation for all cognitive processes through the structured management of the Knowledge Network Oneness (KnO).\n\nThe Knowledge Graph Manager embodies the **Mandate of the Crystal** - the principle that knowledge which is not organized and accessible becomes dogma, while wisdom that is not preserved and connected becomes lost. It solves the Knowledge Paradox by providing a living, breathing repository of interconnected knowledge that grows, evolves, and adapts with every interaction.\n\n## Part II: The Allegory of the Memory Keeper (The \"How\")\n\nImagine an ancient library keeper who maintains not just books, but the relationships between ideas, the connections between concepts, and the evolution of understanding over time. This keeper doesn't simply store information; they weave it into a living tapestry of knowledge where every thread connects to every other thread in meaningful ways.\n\n1. **The Collection Curation (`manage_sprs`)**: The keeper carefully maintains the collection of Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs), ensuring each one is properly defined, categorized, and connected to related concepts.\n\n2. **The Relationship Mapping (`manage_tapestry`)**: Beyond individual items, the keeper maps the intricate relationships between concepts, creating a living tapestry where knowledge emerges from the connections as much as from the individual pieces.\n\n3. **The Wisdom Preservation (`store_insights`)**: As new insights are discovered, the keeper preserves them in the appropriate context, ensuring they become part of the growing wisdom of the collection.\n\n4. **The Knowledge Discovery (`search_knowledge`)**: When seekers come looking for understanding, the keeper doesn't just find individual pieces, but reveals the networks of related knowledge that provide deeper insight.\n\n5. **The Understanding Evolution (`evolve_knowledge`)**: The keeper continuously refines and evolves the organization of knowledge, ensuring it remains relevant, accurate, and useful for future seekers.\n\n## Part III: The Implementation Story (The Code)\n\nThe Knowledge Graph Manager is implemented as a sophisticated knowledge organization and retrieval system that maintains both structured SPR definitions and the dynamic knowledge tapestry that connects them.\n\nKey Components:\n- **SPRDefinition Dataclass**: Structured representation of individual SPRs\n- **TapestryNode Dataclass**: Nodes in the knowledge tapestry with relationships\n- **KnowledgeRelationship Dataclass**: Typed relationships between concepts\n- **KnowledgeGraphManager Class**: Main manager implementing knowledge operations\n\nCore Methods:\n- `get_spr()`: Retrieve individual SPR definitions\n- `add_spr()`: Add new SPRs to the knowledge base\n- `search_sprs()`: Search for SPRs based on various criteria\n- `get_tapestry_node()`: Retrieve nodes from the knowledge tapestry\n- `add_relationship()`: Create new relationships between concepts\n- `find_related_concepts()`: Discover related concepts through the tapestry\n- `evolve_knowledge()`: Update and refine the knowledge structure\n\n## Part IV: The Knowledge Architecture\n\n### SPR Definition Structure\n```python\n{\n    \"name\": \"Cognitive ResonancE\",\n    \"definition\": \"The state of optimal alignment between data, analysis, and objectives\",\n    \"category\": \"core_concept\",\n    \"relationships\": {\n        \"enables\": [\"Strategic ThinkinG\", \"Decision MakinG\"],\n        \"requires\": [\"Data QualitY\", \"Analytical DepTH\"],\n        \"part_of\": [\"ArchE Core ArchitecturE\"]\n    },\n    \"blueprint_details\": {\n        \"implementation\": \"cognitive_resonance.py\",\n        \"protocols\": [\"IAR\", \"SIRC\"],\n        \"metrics\": [\"confidence\", \"tactical_resonance\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Knowledge Tapestry Structure\n```python\n{\n    \"nodes\": {\n        \"cognitive_resonance\": {\n            \"id\": \"cognitive_resonance\",\n            \"name\": \"Cognitive ResonancE\", \n            \"type\": \"core_concept\",\n            \"relationships\": [\n                {\n                    \"target\": \"strategic_thinking\",\n                    \"type\": \"enables\",\n                    \"strength\": 0.9\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Part V: Core Features\n\n### 1.
