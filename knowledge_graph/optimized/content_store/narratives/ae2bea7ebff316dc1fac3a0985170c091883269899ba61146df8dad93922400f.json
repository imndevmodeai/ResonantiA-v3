{"content": "TERM: Comparative Fluxual Processing (CFP) Framework\n\nDEFINITION:\nComparative Fluxual Processing (CFP) treats complex systems as evolving quantum-like waves rather than static snapshots. It models two primary fluxes:\n- Flux A (Operational River): Grounded, metadata-rich, executable. Carries task_keys, run_ids, Hamiltonian evolution operators, consensus diagnostics—practical currents that power immediate action.\n- Flux B (Cognitive River): Rarefied, strategic, symmetrical. Provides higher-order processing and strategic guidance with confidence 0.85 that it sits \"Above\".\n\nThe confluence of these fluxes creates emergence: new ecosystems of symmetrical intelligence where operational execution and cognitive oversight merge, producing capabilities neither flux alone could achieve.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nCFP Framework concept from Quantum River chronicle. Part of Comparative Fluxual Processing architecture.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nApply CFP to analyze Comparative Fluxual Processing in ArchE's operational-cognitive balance.\n\nCATEGORY: CorePrinciple\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: CFP Framework; source: cfp_chronicle; source_type: cfp_chronicle; related_to: ComparativE fluxuaL processinG, QuantumfluxsimulatoR, ActioncontexT, ActioncontextcognitivE"}
