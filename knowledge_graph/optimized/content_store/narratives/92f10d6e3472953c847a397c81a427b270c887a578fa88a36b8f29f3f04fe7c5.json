{"content": "TERM: Codebase Reference and Documentation Synchronization Protocol\n\nDEFINITION:\nA critical protocol for maintaining synchronization between codebase references and documentation. It ensures that implementation details remain aligned with specifications and documentation.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nCRDSP protocol implementation across the entire codebase, ensuring that all code references, documentation, and specifications remain synchronized and aligned with Implementation Resonance principles.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nThe CRDSP ensures that when the Perception Engine implementation is updated, all related documentation, specifications, and code references are automatically synchronized to maintain Implementation Resonance.\n\nCATEGORY: SystemProtocol\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: SynchronizationProtocol; ensures: Implementation Resonance, Documentation Accuracy, Code-Doc Alignment; governs: Code References, Documentation Updates, Specification Alignment; enables: As Above, So Below, Consistency Maintenance, Quality Assurance; confidence: high"}
