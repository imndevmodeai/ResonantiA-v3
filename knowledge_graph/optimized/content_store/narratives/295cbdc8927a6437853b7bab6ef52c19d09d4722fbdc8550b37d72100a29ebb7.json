{"content": "TERM: Cognitive Flux (Flux B)\n\nDEFINITION:\nThe Cognitive River (Flux B) in CFP: black-water, deeper, quieter strategic oversight. Includes:\n- Action Context Cognitive Capability: Meta-guidance, the \"why\" behind the \"how\"\n- Higher-order processing: Strategic guidance with confidence 0.85\n- Long-term resonance: Ensures symmetry so operational surges don't flood without strategic banks\n\nThis flux is rarefied, strategic, and symmetrical. It provides higher-order processing and strategic guidance. It is the black water of long-term resonance, ensuring symmetry so no operational surge floods without strategic banks. Like strategic oversight asking \"What if we scale tooling learning across both lines forever?\"\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nCFP Framework concept from Quantum River chronicle. Part of Comparative Fluxual Processing architecture.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nApply CFP to analyze Cognitive Flux in ArchE's operational-cognitive balance.\n\nCATEGORY: CorePrinciple\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: CFP Framework; source: cfp_chronicle; source_type: cfp_chronicle; related_to: ComparativE fluxuaL processinG, QuantumfluxsimulatoR, ActioncontexT, ActioncontextcognitivE"}
