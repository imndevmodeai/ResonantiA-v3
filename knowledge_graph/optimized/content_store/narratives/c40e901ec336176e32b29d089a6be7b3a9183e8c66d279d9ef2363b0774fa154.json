Original SPR name: 'Query Optimizer'\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\n unresponsive data sources, or invalid data formats [4]. Robust error handling mechanisms would ensure the system can gracefully recover from such issues, providing informative error messages and potentially retrying the operation or logging the error for further investigation.\nIntegration with the Query Optimizer: The query executor works in tandem with the Query Optimizer, which generates the optimized query plan [5, 6]. The executor relies on this plan to determine the most efficient sequence\n\nCATEGORY: ExtractedKnowledge\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: SPRFromAgi; source: agi.txt; original_format: capitalized_concept\n\nCONTEXT TYPE: Conversation-derived knowledge (no direct spec/code, enriched from agi.txt conversations)\n\nIMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE: This SPR represents knowledge understood through conversation context and osmosis"}
