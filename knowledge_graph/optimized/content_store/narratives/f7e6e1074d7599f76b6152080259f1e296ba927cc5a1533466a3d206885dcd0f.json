The executor relies on this plan to determine the most efficient sequence of operations for retrieving the data. For instance, the optimizer might suggest fetching data from a local cache before making a network request or splitting a complex query into smaller, more manageable sub-queries. The executor needs to interpret and execute these instructions accurately to ensure optimal performance.\nIn summary, the query executor is a vital component of any data extraction engine, responsible for translating the optimized query plan into actions that retrieve the desired information from various sources. Its design and implementation significantly impact the efficiency, robustness, and overall effectiveness of the data extraction process.\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Data Processing in Data Extraction\nData processing is a crucial stage in any data extraction pipeline, particularly when building a machine learning engine like AgentQL.
