{"content": "TERM: Human Factor Modeling\n\nDEFINITION:\nA conceptual capability within Complex System Visioning to realistically simulate the influence of human behaviors, cognitive biases, emotional states (e.g., FearLeveL, MoralE), and social interactions on emergent system dynamics. Integrates with Agent-Based Modeling. Enhanced with systemic family and relationship dynamics from Hellinger's work, including generational patterns, systemic conscience, belonging needs, and balance of giving/taking.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSee ResonantiA Protocol v3.1-CA, Section 3.15, Section 7.14 (ABM enhancements).\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nPractical application of Human Factor Modeling within the ResonantiA Protocol framework\n\nCATEGORY: SimulationComponent\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: SimulationAttribute; part_of: Complex system visioninG, Agent based modelinG; models_aspects: CognitiveBiases, EmotionalStates, SocialInteractions, Family system dynamics, Generational patterns, Systemic relationships; enhanced_by_systemic_principles: OrdersoflovE, SystemicbelonginG, BalanceofgivingandtakinG, SystemicentanglemenT, GenerationallegacY, SystemicconsciencE; contributes_to: EmergentBehaviorRealism, Relationship system accuracy, Multi-generational analysis; supports_conceptual: PsychologicalProfiling, BehavioralEconomics, Family systems therapy, Systemic psychotherapy; confidence: high"}
