{"content": "TERM: Scenario Realism Assessment\n\nDEFINITION:\nA critical evaluation step, often guided by the Vetting Agent, within Complex System Visioning. It scrutinizes a simulation's assumptions, parameterization, emergent dynamics, and outcomes against real-world knowledge, theoretical plausibility, and the simulation's IAR data to ensure results are properly contextualized.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSee ResonantiA Protocol v3.0, Section 2.10.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nPractical application of Scenario Realism Assessment within the ResonantiA Protocol framework\n\nCATEGORY: SystemProcess\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: ValidationStep; is_part_of: ComplexSystemVisioninG; guided_by: VettingAgenT; evaluates: SimulationAssumptions, ParameterFidelity, EmergentDynamics; can_trigger: Metacognitive shifT; confidence: high"}
