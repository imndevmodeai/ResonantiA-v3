If you have any questions or would like to stop, please let me know.\n\nContinue\n\nTo further enhance the system, we can integrate a Knowledge Graph Embedding module to learn vector representations of the knowledge graph. This will enable the system to perform tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph clustering.\n\nConfidence: 0.265\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSPR extracted from agi.txt Node 53, type: node_format.
