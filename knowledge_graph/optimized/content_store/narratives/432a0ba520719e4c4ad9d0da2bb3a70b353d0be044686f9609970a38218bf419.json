{"content": "A dual-format preservation mechanism that ensures Guardian pointS format SPR IDs are never lost when normalized for Python code use. The mechanism maintains three preservation layers: (1) Original Guardian pointS format in spr_id field (never modified), (2) Normalized Python-safe identifiers via normalized_id property (cached on-demand), (3) Complete preservation mapping dictionary tracking all SPRs. This ensures SPR Decompressor recognition while enabling Python code compatibility. The ActivatedSPR dataclass automatically preserves original format in _original_guardian_format backup, and the ObjectiveGenerationEngine maintains a guardian_format_preservation_map for complete tracking."}
