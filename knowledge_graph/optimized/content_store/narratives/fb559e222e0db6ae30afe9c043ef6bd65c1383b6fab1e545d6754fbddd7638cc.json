{"content": "TERM: Complex System Visioning\n\nDEFINITION:\nAn advanced capability within ResonantiA v3.1-CA to develop high-fidelity simulations and analyses of complex, adaptive systems, often incorporating environmental dynamics, agent-level behaviors, and conceptual HumanFactorModelinG to explore emergent outcomes and strategic trajectories. Enhanced with systemic principles from Hellinger's work on relationship systems, including OrdersoflovE, HiddensymmetrY, and SystemicbalancE.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSee ResonantiA Protocol v3.1-CA, Preamble, Section 3.15.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nPractical application of Complex System Visioning within the ResonantiA Protocol framework\n\nCATEGORY: CognitiveCapability\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: AdvancedSimulation; integrates: Agent based modelinG, ComparativE fluxuaL processinG, Causal inferencE; incorporates_conceptual: HumanFactorModelinG, EnvironmentalDynamics; enhanced_by_systemic_principles: OrdersoflovE, HiddensymmetrY, SystemicconsciencE, SystemicbalancE, FamilyconstellationDynamiC; enables: ScenarioExploration, StrategicForecasting, Relationship system modeling, Generational pattern analysis; supports_principle: 4d thinkinG, Temporal resonancE, CollectiveWellbeing; confidence: high"}
