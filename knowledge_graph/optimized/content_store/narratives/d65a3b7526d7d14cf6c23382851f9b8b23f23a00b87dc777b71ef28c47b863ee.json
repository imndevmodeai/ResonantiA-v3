{"content": "TERM: Device Integration\n\nDEFINITION:\nDevice Integration: Node 129: Device Integration\n\nConfidence: 0.645\n\n[From agi.txt]: Edges:\n\n[From Codebase]: The `create_reflection` function is a foundational utility integrated across nearly every tool in the system.\n\n**Example Workflow:**\n\n1.  The `code_executor` tool runs a piece of Python code.\n2.  The execution takes 1.2 seconds and completes successfully but generates a depreciation warning.\n3.  Inside the `code_executor`'s logic, it calls `create_reflection`:\n    ```python\n    from .utils.reflection_utils import create_reflection, ExecutionStatus\n\n    # ... execution logic ...\n\n    reflection = create_reflection(\n        action_name=\"execute_code\",\n        status=ExecutionStatus.WARNING,\n        message=\"Code executed successfully, but a depreciation warning was captured.\",\n        inputs={'code': '...'},\n        outputs={'stdout': '...', 'stderr': 'DeprecationWarning...'},\n        confidence=0.9,\n        potential_issues=[\"Depreciation warning may cause issues in future versions.\"],\n        execution_time=1.2\n    )\n    return result, reflection\n    ```\n4.  This standardized dictionary is then passed to the `IARValidator` and `ResonanceTracker`, which can reliably parse it because it was created by the canonical factory function.\n\n[From Codebase]: - **IAR Compliance**: Full Integrated Action Reflection support\n- **Workflow Compatibility**: Seamless integration with ArchE's workflow system\n- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive statistics and performance tracking\n\nThis Living Specification ensures that the Enhanced Perception Engine is understood not just as a search tool, but as a sophisticated digital archaeologist that can excavate, analyze, and synthesize knowledge from the vast digital landscape, enabling ArchE to solve the Oracle's Paradox through proactive truth-seeking and verification.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSPR extracted from agi.txt Node 129, type: node_format.
