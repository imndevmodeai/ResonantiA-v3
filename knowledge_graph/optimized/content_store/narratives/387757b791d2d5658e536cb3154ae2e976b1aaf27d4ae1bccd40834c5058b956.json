{"content": "TERM: Operational Flux (Flux A)\n\nDEFINITION:\nThe Operational River (Flux A) in CFP: dark, sediment-rich waters of practical execution. Includes:\n- ActionContext: Runtime context passed to every action\n- CollectiveIntelligenceNetwork: Orchestrates multiple ArchE instances toward consensus\n- QuantumFluxSimulator: Initializes state vectors and applies decoherence\n- Workflows: Fast, visible production lines\n\nThis flux is grounded, metadata-rich, and executable. It carries task_keys, run_ids, Hamiltonian evolution operators, consensus diagnostics—practical currents that power immediate action. Like Tesla's parallel Model 3 and Model Y production ramps, it is the visible, sediment-laden waters of operational urgency.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nCFP Framework concept from Quantum River chronicle. Part of Comparative Fluxual Processing architecture.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nApply CFP to analyze Operational Flux in ArchE's operational-cognitive balance.\n\nCATEGORY: CorePrinciple\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: CFP Framework; source: cfp_chronicle; source_type: cfp_chronicle; related_to: ComparativE fluxuaL processinG, QuantumfluxsimulatoR, ActioncontexT, ActioncontextcognitivE"}
