{"content": "TERM: Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nDEFINITION:\nDeep Reinforcement Learning: Finally, we can integrate a Transfer Learning module to enable the system to transfer knowledge across different domains and tasks. This will enable the system to learn from one task and apply that knowledge to another task.\n\nConfidence: 0.86\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSPR extracted from agi.txt Node 172, type: node_format.
