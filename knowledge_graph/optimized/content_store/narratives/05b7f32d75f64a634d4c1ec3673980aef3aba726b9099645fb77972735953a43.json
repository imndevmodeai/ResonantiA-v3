{"content": "A preservation strategy that maintains both original Guardian pointS format and normalized Python-safe versions of SPR IDs simultaneously. This enables zero data loss while providing Python code compatibility. The dual format is accessed through: spr_id (original Guardian pointS format for SPR recognition) and normalized_id property (Python-safe identifier for code use). Both formats are preserved in memory, cached for performance, and included in output dictionaries for persistence."}
