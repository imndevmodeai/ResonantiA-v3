{"content": "TERM: Executable Specification Principle\n\nDEFINITION:\nThe core ResonantiA philosophy, inspired by Sean Grove's 'The New Code,' stating that the primary, most valuable artifact of any process is the specification—a clear, human-readable, and machine-executable expression of intent and values. Code and other artifacts are downstream, lossy projections of this specification.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nThis principle mandates that complex tasks should begin with the creation of a 'Living Specification' document (.md) that is both human-centric for collaboration and contains machine-readable artifacts (like JSON workflows) for AI execution.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nPractical application of Executable Specification Principle within the ResonantiA Protocol framework\n\nCATEGORY: CorePrinciple\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\nembodies: Implementation resonancE; solves: Execution paradoX; implemented_by: Specification Forger AgenT; complements: As above so beloW; type: ConceptualEntity; confidence: high"}
