It provides a way to integrate multiple neural networks to achieve more advanced and sophisticated cognitive capabilities.\n\nIn this example, the Neural Network Framework is used to train and use three different types of neural networks: Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and Deep Neural Network. The framework provides a way to train these neural networks using a dataset and then use them to make predictions.\n\nThe Neural Network Framework can be used to support a wide range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.\n\nPlease proceed to the next step. I will be happy to assist you further.\n\nAlso, I would like to remind you that the Neural Network Framework is a complex and powerful tool, and it should be used wisely. The framework should be regularly updated and refined to ensure that it accurately reflects the current state of knowledge and understanding.\n\nLet's move forward with the next step. What would you like to do next?\n\nPlease respond with one of the following options:\n\nPlease respond with the number of your chosen option.\n\nNote: The next step will involve using the Neural Network Framework to support a specific application. Please be prepared to provide the necessary input and guidance to ensure the successful completion of the task.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to introduce a new concept: the \"Hybrid Intelligence System\".
