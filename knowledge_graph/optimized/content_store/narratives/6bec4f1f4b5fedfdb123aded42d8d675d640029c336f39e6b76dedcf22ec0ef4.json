{"content": "TERM: Core Workflow Engine\n\nDEFINITION:\nThe heart of the Mind Forge; the central component of ArchE responsible for orchestrating the execution of tasks as defined in Process Blueprints (workflows). It manages the flow of control, handles data dependencies between tasks, evaluates conditional logic (Phasegates), and ensures IAR data is generated and passed into the context for subsequent steps.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSee ResonantiA Protocol v3.0, Section 3.3, 7.3.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nPractical application of Core Workflow Engine within the ResonantiA Protocol framework\n\nCATEGORY: CoreComponent\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: Orchestrator; executes: Process blueprintS; manages: TaskDependencies, ContextFlow, PhasegateS; enforces: Iar compliance vettinG; implemented_in: workflow_engine.py; confidence: high"}
