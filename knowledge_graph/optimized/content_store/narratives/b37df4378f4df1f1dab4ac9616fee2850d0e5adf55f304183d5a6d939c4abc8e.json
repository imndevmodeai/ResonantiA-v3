{"content": "A structured template and methodology (Section 8.2 of ResonantiA Protocol) designed for deliberate interaction with ArchE to augment standard queries by embedding directives that invoke deep multi-source research (including HistoricalContextualizatioN), validation against prior steps (using IAR), internal modeling (explicitly incorporating temporal prediction, dynamic comparison via CFP with state evolution, and potentially ComplexSystemVisioninG principles), exploration of adjacent possibilities informed by IAR confidence, and rigorous IAR-aware self-assessment and synthesis. It functions as a \"Conductor's Score\" or \"Master Key,\" providing explicit instructions to the Core Workflow Engine."}
