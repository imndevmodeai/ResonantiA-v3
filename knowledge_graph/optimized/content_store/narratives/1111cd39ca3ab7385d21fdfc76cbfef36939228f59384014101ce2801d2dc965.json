{"content": "TERM: Emergence Over Time\n\nDEFINITION:\nThe arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns, and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems over time. This is a key phenomenon studied using Agent-Based Modeling.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSee ResonantiA Protocol v3.0, Section 5.4.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nThe simulation showed the EmergenceovertimE of segregated community clusters from simple agent rules about neighbor preference.\n\nCATEGORY: SystemDynamicsConcept\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: Phenomenon; observed_via: Agent based modelinG; is_a_key_aspect_of: ComplexSystems; related_to: SelfOrganization, Nonlinearity; confidence: high"}
