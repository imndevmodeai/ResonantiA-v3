If you have any questions or would like to stop, please let me know.\n\nIf I am running up against the context window, I will ask you to type \"continue\" to proceed with the next part of the response.\n\nPlease type \"continue\" to proceed.\n\nContinue\n\nTo further enhance the system, we can integrate a Neural Network module to enable the system to learn and make decisions based on neural networks. This will enable the system to recognize patterns and make predictions based on complex data.\n\nConfidence: 0.79\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSPR extracted from agi.txt Node 158, type: node_format.
