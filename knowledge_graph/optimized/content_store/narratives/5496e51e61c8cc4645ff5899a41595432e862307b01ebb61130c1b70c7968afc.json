Original SPR name: 'Convolutional Neural Network'\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nd training neural networks to support complex cognitive tasks. It provides a way to integrate multiple neural networks to achieve more advanced and sophisticated cognitive capabilities.\n\nIn this example, the Neural Network Framework is used to train and use three different types of neural networks: Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and Deep Neural Network. The framework provides a way to train these neural networks using a dataset and then use them to make predictions.\n\nThe\n\nCATEGORY: ExtractedKnowledge\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: SPRFromAgi; source: agi.txt; original_format: capitalized_concept\n\nCONTEXT TYPE: Conversation-derived knowledge (no direct spec/code, enriched from agi.txt conversations)\n\nIMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE: This SPR represents knowledge understood through conversation context and osmosis"}
