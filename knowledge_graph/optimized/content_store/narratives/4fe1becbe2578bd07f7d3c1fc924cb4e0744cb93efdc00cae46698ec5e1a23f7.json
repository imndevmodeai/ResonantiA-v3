They emphasize the need for a robust Query Executor component capable of handling diverse data sources efficiently.\nHere's a breakdown of key aspects related to query execution, drawing upon the provided sources:\nHandling Diverse Data Sources: A well-designed query executor should be versatile enough to interact with a variety of data sources. This might include websites, APIs, databases, or even files stored locally or on cloud platforms [1]. The executor needs to understand the specific protocols and formats associated with each data source to successfully retrieve the desired information. For instance, when interacting with a website, the executor might need to use web crawling libraries like Scrapy or BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML structure and extract the relevant data [2].
