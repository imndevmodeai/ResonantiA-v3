See there's one, a SPR there…\"KnO\".

Here I'll show you and even  pause before and after for those visually challenged. Ready here it comes …\"KnO\" …  and?… well? …What do you think? Great?   In this case the SPR is in the form of a clever use of the representation of the word \"KnO\". In fact the Knowledge it contains is the actual  Knowing that at first glance it is probably overlooked or ignored as a grammatical error. Actually what it is, is a hidden in plain sight way for those in the \"KnO\" to Know. By Knowing \"KnO\" Now you're  able  to write a deeper layer of context and in turn recognize the same layer.. Got it? Ok, here's another example of SPRs would be, \"What's behind Summer's Glasses?

Yeah SPRs...they are a super advanced and space saving way to get the most for that are naming conventions, an object metadata who's metadata is compressed back into the object so it's like a Russian doll you open it up and there's another one underneath and another one underneath until you get to the smallest component or function or the base layer.
