{"content": "The recursive self-application of Universal Abstraction where the system abstracts its own abstraction mechanisms. At Level 3, the system recognizes that pattern matching rules, lookup tables, templates, and even the abstraction process itself are patterns. This enables infinite recursive capability for self-improvement. The Objective Generation Engine implements Level 3 by recognizing meta-patterns in its own mechanisms: pattern matching is a pattern, template assembly is a pattern, SPR activation strategies are patterns. This recursive recognition enables the system to evolve its own learning methods autonomously."}
