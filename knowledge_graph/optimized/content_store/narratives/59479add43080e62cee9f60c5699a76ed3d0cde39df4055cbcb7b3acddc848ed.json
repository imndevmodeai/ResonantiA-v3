{"content": "A scalable agent framework that incorporates Comparative Fluxual Processing (CFP)\n    and dynamic operator selection for flexible and context-aware behavior.\n\n    This agent model is designed to operate in complex environments, leveraging CFP\n    to analyze system dynamics and adapt its behavior through dynamic operator selection.\n    It supports multiple workflow modes and action registries for extensibility.\n\n    Attributes:\n        agent_id (str): Unique identifier for the agent.\n        initial_state (np.ndarray): Initial state vector of the agent.\n        operators (Dict[str, np.ndarray]): Dictionary of operators available to the agent,\n                                         keyed by descriptive names (e.g., 'explore', 'exploit').\n        action_registry (Dict[str, Callable]): Registry of actions the agent can perform,\n                                              keyed by action names. Actions are functions.\n        workflow_modes (Dict[str, List[str]]): Defines workflow modes as lists of action names.\n        current_operator_key (str): Key for the operator currently in use.\n        operator_selection_strategy (Callable[[ScalableAgent], str]): Strategy function\n                                                                    to dynamically select the operator.\n        state_history (List[np.ndarray]): History of agent states.\n        flux_history (List[float]): History of flux values.\n\n    Args:\n        agent_id (str): Identifier for the agent.\n        initial_state (np.ndarray): Initial state vector.\n        operators (Dict[str, np.ndarray]): Operators dictionary.\n        action_registry (Dict[str, Callable]): Action registry.\n        workflow_modes (Dict[str, List[str]]): Workflow modes dictionary.\n        operator_selection_strategy (Callable[[ScalableAgent], str]): Operator selection strategy function.\n        initial_operator_key (str, optional): Initial operator key to use. Defaults to the first key in operators.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: if operators dictionary is empty.\n        ValueError: if initial_operator_key is not found in operators."}
