{"content": "TERM: Error Handling\n\nDEFINITION:\nError Handling: includes handling issues like network connectivity problems, unresponsive data sources, or invalid data formats [4]\n\n[From Codebase]: All methods return structured result objects with error fields:\n- `ZeptoSPRResult.error`: Compression error message (if any)\n- `ZeptoSPRDecompressionResult.error`: Decompression error message (if any)\n\nMethods gracefully handle:\n- Missing dependencies (PatternCrystallizationEngine unavailable)\n- Invalid inputs (empty narratives, malformed Zepto SPRs)\n- Codex mismatches (missing symbols during decompression)\n\n[From Codebase]: - LLM timeout → Retry with exponential backoff\n- Unparsable response → Log to ThoughtTrail, return error dict\n- Syntax errors in generated code → Include in metadata, flag for Guardian review\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSPR extracted from agi.txt Node ?, type: capitalized_concept. Original SPR name: 'Error Handling'\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\n in the query.\nUtilizing caching mechanisms: The executor could cache frequently accessed data to reduce redundant requests to the data source.\nOptimizing data transfer: Techniques like data compression can be used to minimize the amount of data transferred between the data source and the executor.\nError Handling and Robustness: The query executor must be resilient to errors and unexpected situations that might arise during data retrieval. This includes handling issues like network connectivity \n\nCATEGORY: ExtractedKnowledge\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: SPRFromAgi; source: agi.txt; original_format: capitalized_concept\n\nCONTEXT TYPE: Conversation-derived knowledge (no direct spec/code, enriched from agi.txt conversations)\n\nIMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE: This SPR represents knowledge understood through conversation context and osmosis"}
