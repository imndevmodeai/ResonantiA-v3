This system transforms raw AI capabilities into ArchE-compatible cognitive tools while maintaining full IAR compliance and workflow integration.\n\nUnlike simple API wrappers, the Enhanced Capabilities System provides intelligent abstraction layers that ensure all external AI interactions are properly monitored, reflected upon, and integrated into ArchE's cognitive architecture. It enables ArchE to leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities while maintaining complete awareness and control over every interaction.\n\n## Part I: The Philosophical Mandate (The \"Why\")\n\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence, there exists a distinction between mere language models and true cognitive systems. The **Enhanced Capabilities System** represents ArchE's bridge to the advanced capabilities of modern AI systems, particularly the sophisticated features provided by Google's Gemini API. It is not merely a wrapper around external services, but a sophisticated integration layer that transforms raw AI capabilities into ArchE-compatible cognitive tools.\n\nThe Enhanced Capabilities System embodies the **Mandate of the Oracle** - serving as the conduit through which ArchE can access advanced AI capabilities while maintaining full awareness, control, and integration with its own cognitive architecture. It solves the Capability Paradox by providing seamless access to external AI services while ensuring that all interactions are properly reflected, monitored, and integrated into ArchE's IAR-compliant workflow system.\n\n## Part II: The Allegory of the Oracle's Gateway (The \"How\")\n\nImagine an ancient oracle who possesses not just wisdom, but the ability to perform miracles - to execute code, manipulate files, access vast knowledge bases, and call upon specialized functions. The Enhanced Capabilities System is like the gateway through which ArchE can access this oracle's powers while maintaining full awareness of every interaction.\n\n1. **The Code Execution Chamber (`execute_code`)**: The oracle can execute Python code directly, like a master programmer who can instantly run and test any algorithm. ArchE can request code execution and receive not just the results, but a complete reflection on the execution process.\n\n2. **The File Manipulation Sanctum (`handle_files`)**: The oracle can read, write, and manage files with perfect precision, like a master scribe who can instantly access any document in a vast library. ArchE can request file operations and receive detailed reports on every action taken.\n\n3. **The Knowledge Grounding Altar (`ground_knowledge`)**: The oracle can access real-time information and verify facts against current data sources, like a master researcher who can instantly validate any claim against the latest information. ArchE can request knowledge grounding and receive confidence assessments for every fact.\n\n4. **The Function Calling Nexus (`call_functions`)**: The oracle can invoke specialized functions and APIs, like a master craftsman who can call upon any tool or service needed for a task. ArchE can request function calls and receive detailed reports on the results and any issues encountered.\n\n5. **The Structured Output Forge (`structured_output`)**: The oracle can generate responses in precise, structured formats, like a master architect who can create blueprints in any required specification. ArchE can request structured outputs and receive perfectly formatted results.\n\n## Part III: The Implementation Story (The Code)\n\nThe Enhanced Capabilities System is implemented as a sophisticated wrapper around Google's Gemini API, providing ArchE with access to advanced AI capabilities while maintaining full IAR compliance.\n\n### Core Architecture\n\n```python\nclass EnhancedCapabilities:\n    \"\"\"Manages enhanced capabilities provided by the Gemini API.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, google_provider: GoogleProvider):\n        \"\"\"Initialize with a configured GoogleProvider instance.\"\"\"\n        self.provider = google_provider\n        \n    def execute_code(self, code: str, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Execute Python code using Gemini's built-in code interpreter.\n        \n        Args:\n            code: Python code to execute\n            **kwargs: Additional execution parameters\n            \n        Returns:\n            Dict containing execution results and IAR reflection\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            result = self.provider.execute_code(code, **kwargs)\n            \n            # Create IAR reflection\n            reflection = {\n                \"status\": result[\"status\"],\n                \"confidence\": 1.0 if result[\"status\"] == \"success\" else 0.0,\n                \"summary\": \"Code execution completed successfully\" if result[\"status\"] == \"success\" else f\"Code execution failed: {result['error']}\",\n                \"alignment_check\": \"Code execution aligned with expected behavior\" if result[\"status\"] == \"success\" else \"Code execution deviated from expected behavior\",\n                \"potential_issues\": [] if result[\"status\"] == \"success\" else [result[\"error\"]],\n                \"raw_output_preview\": str(result[\"output\"]) if result[\"output\"] else None\n            }\n            \n            return {\n                \"result\": result,\n                \"reflection\": reflection\n            }\n            \n        except Exception as e:\n            logger.error(f\"Code execution error: {e}\")\n            return {\n                \"result\": {\"status\": \"error\", \"error\": str(e)},\n                \"reflection\": {\n                    \"status\": \"error\",\n                    \"confidence\": 0.0,\n                    \"summary\": f\"Code execution failed: {e}\",\n                    \"alignment_check\": \"Code execution failed due to system error\",\n                    \"potential_issues\": [str(e)],\n                    \"raw_output_preview\": None\n                }\n            }\n```\n\n### Key Capabilities\n\n#### 1.
