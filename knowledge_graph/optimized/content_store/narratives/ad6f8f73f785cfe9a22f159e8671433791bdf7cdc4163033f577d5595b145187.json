{"content": "TERM: Edge Embedding\n\nDEFINITION:\nEdge Embedding: Next, we can integrate a Graph Neural Network module to learn node and edge representations. This will enable the system to perform tasks such as graph classification, graph regression, and graph generation.\n\nConfidence: 0.3\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSPR extracted from agi.txt Node 60, type: node_format.
