{"content": "Auto-generated workflow for: A highly sophisticated, AI-generated deepfake video has just been released on social media, falsely depicting a world leader making a catastrophic announcement. The video is spreading rapidly. Your mission is to design an emergency response protocol. First, your RISE engine must use its Proactive Truth Resonance Framework (PTRF) in real-time to analyze the video's content and the social media accounts propagating it, in order to produce a high-confidence Solidified Truth Packet debunking the video. Second, use your Agent Based Modeling Tool to simulate the spread of this debunking information versus the original disinformation across a modeled social network of 1 million agents with varying levels of trust and skepticism. Your simulation must identify the optimal intervention strategy (e.g., 'centralized broadcast from official sources' vs. 'decentralized inoculation via trusted influencers'). Finally, synthesize these findings into a step-by-step, actionable emergency response plan for a government agency to execute within the first 60 minutes of the incident."}
