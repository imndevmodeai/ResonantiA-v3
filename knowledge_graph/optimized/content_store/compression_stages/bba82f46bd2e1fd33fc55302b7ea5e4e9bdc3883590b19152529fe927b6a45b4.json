The integration includes: (1) Query pattern history tracking (deque with maxlen=1000), (2) Learned keyword patterns dictionary (autopoietically validated), (3) Learned domain rules dictionary (evolved from experience), (4) Pattern evolution engine integration (recognizes emergent domains). The learning is triggered after each successful objective generation, storing patterns for future use.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nThe Autopoietic Learning Integration operates through: (1) _learn_from_query() method stores query patterns after successful generation, (2) Learned patterns are validated before use, (3) Pattern evolution engine analyzes patterns for emergent domains, (4) MetaPatternManager identifies meta-patterns in learning mechanisms, (5) Graceful fallback if learning components unavailable. Learning uses quantum probability states with evidence tracking.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nAfter processing a query about 'quantum computing applications', the system learns the keyword pattern 'quantum computing' → 'QuantumcomputinG' SPR, stores it in learned_keyword_patterns, and uses it in future queries, improving activation accuracy over time.\n\nCATEGORY: LearningIntegration\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: LearningMechanism; integrates: AutopoieticlearninglooP; into: ObjectiveGenerationEngine; enables: PatternLearning, AdaptiveEvolution, ExperienceBasedImprovement; confidence: high",
