Ethical Reasoning examines strategies through multiple ethical frameworks (utilitarian, deontological, virtue ethics) to identify potential harms, hidden biases (cognitive, social, algorithmic), and negative second-order effects. This ensures strategies are not just effective but also morally defensible and aligned with human values.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nUses temperature 0.5 for balanced ethical analysis. Examines stakeholder impacts, bias risks, and long-term consequences.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nEthics review of an AI hiring tool might flag: potential demographic bias in training data, opacity concerns (candidates can't understand rejections), displacement of human HR workers, privacy implications of data collection, power imbalance (companies hold all decision-making).\n\nCATEGORY: MoralAnalysis\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: EthicalFramework; part_of: HighStakesVettinG; produces: EthicsReporT; enables: MoralValidatioN, BiasDetectioN; considers: UtilitarianEthicS, DeontologicalEthicS, VirtueEthicS; confidence: medium",
