Error Analysis (`analyze_error_details`)\n\nDEFINITION:\n- **Purpose**: Analyze error details and IAR reflections to understand failure causes\n- **Features**: Root cause analysis, confidence assessment, context evaluation\n- **IAR Integration**: Comprehensive error analysis with learning insights\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nExtracted from /mnt/3626C55326C514B1/Happier/specifications/error_handler.md, type: specification_md\n\nFULL SPECIFICATION (error_handler.md):\n# The Guardian of Resilience: A Chronicle of the Error Handler System (v3.1)\n\n## Overview\n\nThe **Error Handler System** is ArchE's sophisticated error recovery and learning system that transforms failures into opportunities for growth and adaptation. This system provides intelligent error detection, analysis, recovery strategies, and learning mechanisms that ensure ArchE becomes more resilient and capable with every challenge it faces.\n\nRather than simply catching and reporting errors, the Error Handler System analyzes failure patterns, selects appropriate recovery strategies, executes intelligent recovery procedures, and captures insights for continuous learning. It embodies ArchE's commitment to resilience and growth, ensuring that every failure becomes a stepping stone toward greater reliability and understanding.\n\n## Part I: The Philosophical Mandate (The \"Why\")\n\nIn the complex landscape of ArchE's cognitive operations, errors are not failures but opportunities for learning, adaptation, and growth. The **Error Handler System** is ArchE's guardian of resilience, the sophisticated system that transforms failures into wisdom, ensuring that every error becomes a stepping stone toward greater reliability and understanding.\n\nThe Error Handler System embodies the **Mandate of the Phoenix** - the principle that from the ashes of failure, wisdom and strength can emerge. It solves the Resilience Paradox by providing intelligent error recovery, adaptive strategies, and comprehensive learning from every failure, ensuring that ArchE becomes more robust with each challenge it faces.\n\n## Part II: The Allegory of the Guardian of Resilience (The \"How\")\n\nImagine a wise guardian who stands watch over ArchE's operations, not to prevent all failures, but to ensure that every failure becomes a source of strength. This guardian doesn't simply catch errors; they analyze them, learn from them, and use them to make ArchE more resilient and capable.\n\n1. **The Error Detection Chamber (`handle_action_error`)**: The guardian's first duty is to detect and analyze errors as they occur. Like a master diagnostician who can identify the root cause of any ailment, the guardian examines error details, context, and IAR reflections to understand what went wrong and why.\n\n2. **The Strategy Selection Altar (`select_error_strategy`)**: Once an error is understood, the guardian selects the most appropriate recovery strategy. Like a master strategist who chooses the right approach for each situation, the guardian considers retry attempts, alternative approaches, and escalation procedures.\n\n3. **The Recovery Execution Forge (`execute_recovery`)**: The guardian then executes the selected recovery strategy. Like a master craftsman who can repair any broken tool, the guardian implements retries, fallbacks, and alternative approaches with precision and care.\n\n4. **The Learning Archive (`capture_error_insights`)**: Every error is carefully documented and analyzed. Like a master scholar who preserves knowledge for future generations, the guardian captures insights, patterns, and lessons learned from each failure.\n\n5. **The Consultation Broadcast (`dispatch_consultation_broadcast`)**: When errors are particularly complex or novel, the guardian broadcasts consultation requests to other ArchE instances. Like a master sage who seeks wisdom from other scholars, the guardian shares knowledge and learns from the collective experience.\n\n## Part III: The Implementation Story (The Code)\n\nThe Error Handler System is implemented as a sophisticated error recovery and learning system that transforms failures into opportunities for growth and adaptation.\n\n### Core Architecture\n\n```python\n# ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 - error_handler.py\n# Defines strategies for handling errors during workflow action execution.\n# Leverages IAR context from error details for more informed decisions.\n\nimport logging\nimport time\nfrom typing import Dict, Any, Optional\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# --- Default Error Handling Settings ---\nDEFAULT_ERROR_STRATEGY = getattr(config, 'DEFAULT_ERROR_STRATEGY', 'retry').lower()\nDEFAULT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = getattr(config, 'DEFAULT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS', 1)\n# Threshold from config used to potentially trigger meta-shift on low confidence failure\nLOW_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = getattr(config, 'METAC_DISSONANCE_THRESHOLD_CONFIDENCE', 0.6)\n\ndef handle_action_error(\n    task_id: str,\n    action_type: str,\n    error_details: Dict[str, Any], # Expected to contain 'error' and potentially 'reflection'\n    context: Dict[str, Any],\n    current_attempt: int,\n    max_attempts: int = DEFAULT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS\n) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Handle errors during action execution with intelligent recovery strategies.\n    \n    Args:\n        task_id: Unique identifier for the task\n        action_type: Type of action that failed\n        error_details: Detailed error information including IAR reflection\n        context: Execution context and state\n        current_attempt: Current attempt number\n        max_attempts: Maximum number of retry attempts\n        \n    Returns:\n        Dict containing recovery strategy and updated context\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Analyze error details and IAR reflection\n        error_analysis = analyze_error_details(error_details, context)\n        \n        # Select appropriate recovery strategy\n        recovery_strategy = select_error_strategy(\n            error_analysis, \n            current_attempt, \n            max_attempts\n        )\n        \n        # Execute recovery strategy\n        recovery_result = execute_recovery(\n            recovery_strategy, \n            task_id, \n            action_type, \n            context\n        )\n        \n        # Capture insights for learning\n        insights = capture_error_insights(error_analysis, recovery_result)\n        \n        return {\n            \"strategy\": recovery_strategy,\n            \"result\": recovery_result,\n            \"insights\": insights,\n            \"context_update\": recovery_result.get(\"context_update\", {})\n        }\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error handler failure: {e}\")\n        return {\n            \"strategy\": \"escalate\",\n            \"result\": {\"status\": \"error\", \"error\": str(e)},\n            \"insights\": {\"handler_failure\": str(e)},\n            \"context_update\": {}\n        }\n```\n\n### Key Components\n\n#### 1.
