This bridge serves as the central nervous system for ArchE's real-time observability, enabling seamless communication between the core cognitive engine and the Visual Cognitive Debugger interface.\n\nThe bridge operates through a comprehensive processing pipeline that transforms incoming text frames through six specialized processors: IARProcessor (Integrated Action Reflection), SPRDetector (Sparse Priming Representation detection), TemporalAnalyzer (temporal context analysis), MetaCognitiveTracker (meta-cognitive state tracking), ComplexSystemVisioningProcessor (complex system analysis), and ImplementationResonanceTracker (CRDSP compliance tracking). The system includes robust connection management with exponential backoff (250ms to 5s cap), heartbeat mechanisms (20s intervals), multi-client fanout capabilities, session scoping, comprehensive security measures (origin allowlists, rate limiting, secret redaction), and extensive testing protocols for unit, integration, and end-to-end validation.\n\n## Purpose\nBridge engine/protocol streams to UI clients; enrich frames with protocol processors (IAR/SPR/Temporal/Meta/Complex/CRDSP) and broadcast as `EnhancedMessage`/`VcdEvent`.\n\n## Responsibilities\n- Accept inbound user/control frames from UI.\n- Initialize/maintain upstream connection to ArchE (or tail engine stdout).\n- Process text frames through processors; emit enriched envelopes/events.\n- Heartbeat, backoff, multi-client fanout, session scoping.\n\n## Interfaces\n- Server: `WEBSOCKET_URL` (e.g., `ws://localhost:3004`).\n- Client→Server: `{ kind: 'user_input'|'control', payload:any }`.\n- Server→Client: `EnhancedMessage` and `VcdEvent` JSON frames.\n\n## Processing Pipeline (reference `webSocketServer.js`)\n1. IARProcessor.process(content) → `iar`.\n2. SPRDetector.detect(content) → `spr_activations`.\n3. TemporalAnalyzer.analyze(content) → `temporal_context`.\n4. MetaCognitiveTracker.track(content) → `meta_cognitive_state`.\n5. ComplexSystemVisioningProcessor.process(content) → `complex_system_visioning`.\n6. ImplementationResonanceTracker.track() → `implementation_resonance`.\n7. Build `EnhancedMessage`; also stream `VcdEvent` for task transitions and thought trail.\n\n## Connection Policy\n- Backoff 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 2s, 4s, 5s cap.\n- Heartbeat ping every 20s; drop timeout 45s; broadcast status.\n- Max clients configurable; per-session room by `session_id`.\n\n## Security\n- Origin allowlist; optional bearer token header; rate limit per IP.\n- Redact secrets; size cap; JSON parse try/catch with error frames.\n\n## Testing\n- Unit: processors mocked; frame transformation tests.\n- Integration: two clients receive identical sequences; disconnect/reconnect.\n- E2E: Phoenix playback; assert workflow start/success and expected markers.\n\n## CRDSP Links\n- Code: `webSocketServer.js`, client `nextjs-chat/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`.\n- Specs: `visual_cognitive_debugger_ui.md`, `protocol_event_schema.md`.\n\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\n- Backoff 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 2s, 4s, 5s cap.\n- Heartbeat ping every 20s; drop timeout 45s; broadcast status.\n- Max clients configurable; per-session room by `session_id`.\n\nCATEGORY: SpecificationKnowledge\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: FromCodebase; source: /mnt/3626C55326C514B1/Happier/specifications/websocket_bridge.md; source_type: specification_md",
