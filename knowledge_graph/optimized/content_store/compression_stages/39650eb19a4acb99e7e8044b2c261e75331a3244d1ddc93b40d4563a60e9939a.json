The SCA is not a separate entity but a cognitive persona that ArchE adopts—like a master architect temporarily becoming a Gothic cathedral specialist or a seismic engineer. SCAs are the primary output of RISE Phase A and the foundation for all subsequent strategic analysis in Phases B, C, and D.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nSCAs are comprehensive profiles (typically 10K-15K tokens) containing all knowledge and frameworks needed for domain-specific strategic reasoning. They are session-specific and dynamically generated per problem.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nFor a supply chain resilience problem, the SCA might be a 'Supply Chain Risk Management Specialist' with expertise in network theory, just-in-time vs just-in-case strategies, geopolitical risk assessment, and multi-tier supplier visibility frameworks.\n\nCATEGORY: CognitiveConstruct\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: DomainExpertiseProfile; created_by: KnowledgeScaffoldinG; used_by: StrategyFusioN, HighStakesVettinG, SPRDistillatioN; comprises: DomainKnowledgeBasE, AnalyticalFrameworkS, StrategicThinkingPatternS, RiskAssessmentMethodologieS, ImplementationGuidancE, ValidationCriteriA; enables: DomainSpecificReasoninG, ExpertStrategicAnalysiS; confidence: high",
