This system serves as the final bridge between strategic planning and tangible reality, allowing ArchE to execute complex calculations, interact with system libraries, and participate in its own evolution.\n\nThe Code Executor provides multiple execution environments with varying levels of security, from fully isolated Docker containers for maximum safety to subprocess execution for trusted code. It embodies ArchE's commitment to safe, controlled action while maintaining the power needed to solve complex problems and participate in its own development and evolution.\n\n## Part I: The Philosophical Mandate (The \"Why\")\n\nTalk is cheap. Analysis, however brilliant, remains confined to the realm of thought. To truly solve the `Execution paradox`, an intelligence must not only think and speak, but *act*. It must be able to build, to change, to create tangible artifacts in its environment.\n\nThe **Code Executor** is the ultimate tool for this purpose. It is the World-Builder's Hammer.\n\nIts mandate is to provide ArchE with the capability to execute code in a secure and controlled manner. This is the most direct and powerful form of action available to the system. It allows ArchE to perform complex calculations, interact with system libraries, manipulate data, and, in its highest form, participate in its own evolution by writing and executing scripts that modify its own components. This tool is the final bridge between the \"As Above\" of a strategic plan and the \"So Below\" of a running, tangible reality. Because of its power, its operation is governed by the strictest safety protocols.\n\n## Part II: The Allegory of the Contained Singularity (The \"How\")\n\nImagine a physicist who has learned to create a miniature, contained singularity—a point of immense creative and destructive power. They cannot simply unleash it in their lab. Instead, they build a suite of **Magnetic Containment Chambers**, each with different properties.\n\n1.  **The Code (The Singularity)**: The physicist receives a blueprint for a specific reaction to run—this is the `code` to be executed.\n\n2.  **The Containment Chambers (The Sandboxes)**: The physicist prepares the appropriate chamber for the task.\n    *   **The Maximum Security Chamber (Docker)**: This is the default. A chamber built from exotic matter, completely isolated from the outside universe. It has its own power, its own physical laws (`dependencies`), and strict resource limits (`--memory`, `--cpus`). Nothing gets in or out. This is the most secure and preferred method of containment.\n    *   **The Shielded Lab (Subprocess)**: For less hazardous, trusted reactions, the physicist might use a shielded room within the main lab. It offers containment but is not fully isolated from the main lab's environment. This method is faster but carries higher risk.\n    *   **The Open Bench (No Sandbox)**: An option so dangerous it is only used under direct, manual override by the chief physicist (`Keyholder OverridE`). It involves running the reaction on an open lab bench, risking the entire facility.\n\n3.  **Initiating the Reaction (Execution)**: The physicist places the blueprint into the chosen chamber and initiates the reaction. The singularity forms, safely confined.\n\n4.  **The Observatory (Monitoring `stdout`, `stderr`)**: The physicist watches the reaction through shielded sensors, monitoring two primary feeds:\n    *   **The Data Feed (`stdout`)**: Shows the expected, structured output.\n    *   **The Anomaly Feed (`stderr`)**: Alerts to errors, instabilities, or unexpected behavior.\n\n5.  **The Emergency Shutdown (The Timeout)**: Every chamber has an automatic emergency shutdown timer. If the reaction runs for too long, the containment field collapses, dissipating the singularity before it can breach containment.\n\n6.  **Retrieving the Results (The IAR-Compliant Output)**: Once complete, the physicist retrieves the data, which is packaged in a standardized report (`Integrated Action Reflection`) detailing the outcome, confidence, and any anomalies.\n\nThe Code Executor tool operates with this level of paranoid caution, choosing the appropriate level of containment for each task while wielding immense power.\n\n## Part III: The Implementation Story (The Code)\n\nThe code translates the containment chambers into a primary execution function that dispatches to different sandboxing methods.\n\n```python\n# In Three_PointO_ArchE/code_executor.py\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\ndef execute_code(inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Execute code in the specified language and return results with IAR reflection.\n\n    Args:\n        inputs (Dict): A dictionary containing:\n            - code (str): The code to execute.\n            - language (str): Programming language (e.g., 'python', 'javascript').\n            - timeout (int): Execution timeout in seconds.\n            - environment (Dict[str, str]): Optional environment variables.\n            - code_path (str): Path to a file containing the code.\n            - input_data (str): Optional string to pass to the script's stdin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ... logic to select sandbox_method (docker, subprocess, or none) ...\n    \n    # --- Dispatches to internal helper functions ---\n    \n    # _execute_with_docker(...)\n    # _execute_with_subprocess(...)\n\n    # --- Returns a standardized dictionary with a 'reflection' key ---\n    # {\n    #     \"result\": {\n    #         \"output\": \"...\",\n    #         \"stderr\": \"...\"\n    #     },\n    #     \"reflection\": {\n    #         \"status\": \"success\" | \"failure\" | \"critical_failure\",\n    #         \"message\": \"...\",\n    #         # ... other IAR fields from reflection_utils.create_reflection ...\n    #     }\n    # }\n\n# The implementation also contains an experimental asynchronous `CodeExecutor`\n# class for future integration with asynchronous workflows.\n```\n\n## Part IV: The Web of Knowledge (SPR Integration)\n\nThe Code Executor is a tool of immense power, sitting at the nexus of thought and reality.\n\n*   **Primary SPR**: `Code executoR`\n*   **Relationships**:\n    *   **`embodies`**: `Implementation resonancE`, `Autopoietic System GenesiS`\n    *   **`requires`**: `Security SandboX`\n    *   **`used_by`**: `RISE`, `Core workflow enginE`\n    *   **`enables`**: `Dynamic Tool CreatioN`, `System Self-ModificatioN`\n    *   **`risk_profile`**: `High - Requires VettingAgent Oversight`\n\nThis Living Specification ensures that the Code Executor is never treated as just another tool, but as the powerful, dangerous, and world-building capability that it is, demanding respect and caution in its use.\n\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nImplementation code:\n\n# In Three_PointO_ArchE/code_executor.py\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\ndef execute_code(inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Execute code in the specified language and return results with IAR reflection.\n\n    Args:\n        inputs (Dict): A dictionary containing:\n            - code (str): The code to execute.\n            - language (str): Programming language (e.g., 'python', 'javascript').\n            - timeout (int): Execution timeout in seconds.\n        \n\nCATEGORY: ImplementationKnowledge\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: FromCodebase; source: /mnt/3626C55326C514B1/Happier/specifications/code_executor.md; source_type: specification_code",
