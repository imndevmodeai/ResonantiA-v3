    "content": "TERM: Dynamic Adaptation Mechanism\n\nDEFINITION:\nA multi-layered adaptation system that enables the Objective Generation Engine to handle any query type through pattern learning, fallback hierarchies, and emergent domain detection. The mechanism includes: (1) Multi-Strategy Fallback Hierarchy (static lookup → learned patterns → emergent domains → universal fallback), (2) Adaptive Domain Detection (recognizes new domains and adapts rules), (3) Autopoietic Learning Integration (learns from each query and evolves), (4) Confidence-Based Routing (routes queries based on confidence scores). This ensures graceful degradation and universal query handling capability.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nThe Dynamic Adaptation Mechanism operates through: (1) Feature extraction handles any query type via universal patterns, (2) SPR activation uses 4-strategy hierarchy (static → learned → emergent → fallback), (3) Mandate selection adapts to query characteristics, (4) Domain customization adapts rules based on detected domain, (5) Pattern evolution engine learns new patterns from each query. All adaptation uses quantum probability states with evidence tracking.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nWhen encountering an unknown query type, the system first tries static keyword lookup, then learned patterns, then emergent domain detection, and finally falls back to universal SPRs (CognitiveResonance, FourdthinkinG), ensuring all queries are handled gracefully.\n\nCATEGORY: AdaptationSystem\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: AdaptiveMechanism; comprises: MultistrategyfallbackhierarchY, AdaptivedomaindetectioN, AutopoieticlearningintegratioN, ConfidencebasedroutinG; enables: UniversalQueryHandling, GracefulDegradation, PatternLearning; implemented_in: ObjectiveGenerationEngine; confidence: high",
