Each executed awareness, generating detailed reports (Φ) about progress, quality, issues encountered. Quality Monitoring (`monitor_progress`)**: Throughout construction P, architect continuously monitors quality, adjusting techniques approaches ABM real-time feedback CRC. P Learning (`capture_insights`)**: After completion, architect captures insights about worked, didn't, similar Pes improved future.
