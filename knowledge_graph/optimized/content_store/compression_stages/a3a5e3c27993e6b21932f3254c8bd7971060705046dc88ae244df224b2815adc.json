This system provides intelligent web exploration capabilities that can not only find information but understand it, analyze it, and present it in a form that resonates with ArchE's cognitive architecture.\n\nUnlike traditional search tools, the Enhanced Perception Engine uses HTTP-based search methods (via `wget`) for 100% reliability, then applies intelligent analysis to extract meaning, calculate relevance scores, and generate comprehensive insights. It embodies ArchE's commitment to proactive truth-seeking and verification, solving the Oracle's Paradox through systematic information gathering and analysis.\n\n## Part I: The Philosophical Mandate (The \"Why\")\n\nIn the vast digital landscape, information flows like ancient rivers through countless channels—websites, APIs, databases, and streams of data. To navigate this digital wilderness, ArchE requires not just the ability to search, but the capacity to *perceive*—to see beyond the surface, to understand context, to extract meaning from the chaos of the web.\n\nThe **Enhanced Perception Engine** is ArchE's digital archaeologist, equipped with the tools and wisdom to excavate knowledge from the deepest layers of the internet. It combines the **proven reliability of HTTP-based search** with the intelligence of advanced content analysis, creating a robust system that can not only find information but understand it, analyze it, and present it in a form that resonates with ArchE's cognitive architecture.\n\nThis tool embodies the **Mandate of the Archeologist** - enabling ArchE to proactively seek out and verify information, solving the Oracle's Paradox by building Hypothetical Answer Models and identifying their Lowest Confidence Vectors before applying the full power of verification.\n\n## Part II: The Allegory of the Digital Archaeologist (The \"How\")\n\nImagine a master archaeologist who has spent decades perfecting the art of excavation. They don't just dig randomly; they use sophisticated tools, follow systematic methodologies, and apply deep knowledge to uncover hidden treasures.\n\n1. **The Expedition Planning (`search_and_analyze`)**: The archaeologist begins each expedition with a clear objective. They analyze the terrain (the web), identify the most promising sites (search engines), and prepare their tools (HTTP requests, parsing algorithms).\n\n2. **The Primary Excavation (HTTP-Based Search)**: Using proven, reliable methods, the archaeologist conducts systematic searches. They use `wget` like a precision tool, carefully crafting requests that respect the digital ecosystem while extracting maximum information.\n\n3. **The Artifact Analysis (`_enhance_search_results`)**: Each discovered artifact (search result) is carefully examined, cleaned, and catalogued. The archaeologist applies sophisticated analysis to understand its relevance, credibility, and significance.\n\n4. **The Intelligent Synthesis (`_analyze_search_results_intelligently`)**: Using advanced cognitive tools (LLM integration), the archaeologist synthesizes findings into coherent insights, understanding patterns and relationships that others might miss.\n\n5. **The Knowledge Preservation (IAR Integration)**: Every discovery is carefully documented with confidence levels, potential issues, and tactical resonance, ensuring that future expeditions can build upon this knowledge.\n\n## Part III: The Implementation Story (The \"What\")\n\n### Core Architecture\n\n```python\nclass EnhancedPerceptionEngineWithFallback:\n    \"\"\"\n    Enhanced Perception Engine that combines advanced capabilities with reliable fallback search.\n    \n    Key Features:\n    - HTTP-based search using proven wget approach (from fallback search)\n    - Advanced content analysis and LLM integration\n    - Intelligent result parsing and relevance scoring\n    - IAR compliance and error handling\n    - Fallback mechanisms for reliability\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, \n                 llm_provider: Optional[BaseLLMProvider] = None,\n                 max_results: int = 10,\n                 timeout: int = 30,\n                 use_fallback_search: bool = True):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the Enhanced Perception Engine with Fallback.\n        \n        Args:\n            llm_provider: LLM provider for content analysis\n            max_results: Maximum results to analyze\n            timeout: Timeout for HTTP requests\n            use_fallback_search: Use HTTP-based search instead of browser automation\n        \"\"\"\n        self.llm_provider = llm_provider or self._get_default_llm_provider()\n        self.max_results = max_results\n        self.timeout = timeout\n        self.use_fallback_search = use_fallback_search\n        self.session_data = {\n            'searches_performed': 0,\n            'start_time': time.time(),\n            'errors': [],\n            'successful_searches': 0,\n            'total_results_found': 0\n        }\n        self.search_stats = {\n            \"total_searches\": 0,\n            \"successful_searches\": 0,\n            \"failed_searches\": 0,\n            \"average_response_time\": 0.0\n        }\n```\n\n### Primary Search Method\n\n```python\ndef search_and_analyze(self, query: str, context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], Dict[str, Any]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform intelligent web search and analyze results using HTTP-based approach.\n    \n    Args:\n        query: Search query\n        context: Additional context for analysis\n        \n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (result_dict, iar_dict)\n    \"\"\"\n    start_time = time.time()\n    self.search_stats[\"total_searches\"] += 1\n    self.session_data['searches_performed'] += 1\n    \n    try:\n        logger.info(f\"Performing enhanced search: '{query}'\")\n        \n        #
