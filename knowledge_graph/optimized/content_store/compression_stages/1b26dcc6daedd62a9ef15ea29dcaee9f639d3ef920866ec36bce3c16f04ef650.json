The Three Layers of the Immune System\n\n### 2.1 Mechanism 1: The Penumbra of Uncertainty (Discovery through \"Fuzzy\" Matches)\n\n- **Principle**: Discovery happens at the fuzzy edges of existing knowledge.\n- **Mechanism**: Queries that are similar but not identical to an existing instinct's pattern will generate a lower-confidence resonance score from the CRCS controller. The `CognitiveIntegrationHub` leverages a **dynamic confidence threshold**.\n- **Implementation**:\n    - If system load is low (as reported by the `SystemHealthMonitor`), the `crcs_threshold` is raised. The system becomes \"pickier,\" rejecting moderately confident matches and forcing them to RISE for re-evaluation.\n    - This forces the system to \"re-think\" problems that are similar to solved ones, creating an opportunity for RISE to discover more efficient solutions using new tools or techniques.\n\n### 2.2 Mechanism 2: The Sentinel of Performance (Discovery through Data-Driven Doubt)\n\n- **Principle**: The system must trust empirical performance over its own stated confidence.\n- **Mechanism**: The `SystemHealthMonitor` continuously tracks the performance of all CRCS controllers (e.g., `avg_duration_ms`, `success_rate`, `guardian_correction_rate`). If a controller's performance degrades or is found to be significantly less efficient than a new pattern discovered by RISE, it is flagged as \"suboptimal.\"\n- **Implementation**:\n    - The `SystemHealthMonitor` sends \"suppression flags\" to the `CognitiveIntegrationHub` for underperforming controllers.\n    - When the Hub receives a high-confidence match from a suppressed controller, it **overrides** that confidence score, forcing it below the escalation threshold.\n    - This forces even perfectly matching queries to be re-evaluated by RISE, allowing the new, superior method to be confirmed and eventually crystallized into an updated instinct.\n\n### 2.3 Mechanism 3: The Agent of Chaos (Discovery through Scheduled Exploration)\n\n- **Principle**: To avoid getting stuck, deliberately introduce a small amount of chaos.\n- **Mechanism**: The `CognitiveIntegrationHub` maintains a small, configurable \"exploration budget\" (e.g., 0.1% of queries).\n- **Implementation**:\n    - For a tiny fraction of incoming queries, the Hub will **intentionally ignore** a perfect, high-confidence match from a CRCS controller.\n    - It treats the perfect match as a failure and escalates the query to RISE, forcing a full re-evaluation from first principles.\n    - While often \"wasteful,\" this guarantees that no instinct, no matter how trusted, is immune from being challenged indefinitely. It is the system's defense against unforeseen changes and its mechanism for serendipitous discovery.\n\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\n- **Principle**: Discovery happens at the fuzzy edges of existing knowledge.\n- **Mechanism**: Queries that are similar but not identical to an existing instinct's pattern will generate a lower-confidence resonance score from the CRCS controller. The `CognitiveIntegrationHub` leverages a **dynamic confidence threshold**.\n- **Implementation**:\n    - If system load is low (as reported by the `SystemHealthMonitor`), the `crcs_threshold` is raised.
