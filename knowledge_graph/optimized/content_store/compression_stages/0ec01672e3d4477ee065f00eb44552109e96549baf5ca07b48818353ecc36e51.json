It prevents code duplication and enforces consistency by providing a single, canonical implementation for ubiquitous tasks.\n\nIn ArchE, the `Three_PointO_ArchE/utils/` directory serves this purpose. Its most critical component, `reflection_utils.py`, contains the `create_reflection` factory function. This function acts as the single source of truth for the creation of Integrated Action Reflection (IAR) dictionaries. By providing a standardized function signature with typed arguments, it ensures that every IAR generated by any tool in the system adheres to the same schema. This structural integrity is paramount for the downstream `IARValidator` and `ResonanceTracker` to function correctly. This document specifies the purpose of the `utils` directory and the precise interface of the `create_reflection` function.\n\n# Utilities - Living Specification\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `Three_PointO_ArchE/utils/` directory is the designated location for common, reusable functions that are shared across multiple components of the ArchE system. It adheres to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle and promotes code consistency.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. `reflection_utils.py` (The IAR Factory)\n\nThis is the most critical utility in the system. It provides the canonical method for creating IAR dictionaries.\n\n#### `create_reflection` Function\n\nThis function is the **only** approved method for generating an IAR. All tools that are registered in the `Action Registry` *must* use this function to generate their self-reflection data.\n\n##### Function Signature\n\n```python\ndef create_reflection(\n    action_name: str,\n    status: ExecutionStatus,\n    message: str,\n    inputs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,\n    outputs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,\n    confidence: Optional[float] = None,\n    alignment_check: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,\n    potential_issues: Optional[List[str]] = None,\n    execution_time: Optional[float] = None,\n) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n```\n\n##### Parameters\n\n-   `action_name` (str): The name of the action being reflected upon.\n-   `status` (`ExecutionStatus`): An enum representing the outcome (e.g., `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `WARNING`).\n-   `message` (str): A human-readable summary of the outcome.\n-   `inputs` (Dict): The inputs provided to the action. The function will automatically create a truncated preview.\n-   `outputs` (Dict): The results from the action. The function will automatically create a truncated preview.\n-   `confidence` (float): A score from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the tool's confidence.\n-   `alignment_check` (Dict): A dictionary assessing alignment with core principles.\n-   `potential_issues` (List[str]): A list of any identified problems or caveats.\n-   `execution_time` (float): The time in seconds the action took to execute.\n\n##### `ExecutionStatus` Enum\n\nThe `status` parameter must be a member of the `ExecutionStatus` enum, which includes:\n- `SUCCESS`\n- `FAILURE`\n- `PENDING`\n- `IN_PROGRESS`\n- `WARNING`\n- `CRITICAL_FAILURE`\n\n### 2. `tsplib_loader.py`\n\nA specialized utility for parsing and loading problem instances from the TSPLIB, a standard library for sample problems for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This is primarily used by the `TSPSolver` tool.\n\n## Integration\n\nThe `create_reflection` function is a foundational utility integrated across nearly every tool in the system.\n\n**Example Workflow:**\n\n1.  The `code_executor` tool runs a piece of Python code.\n2.  The execution takes 1.2 seconds and completes successfully but generates a depreciation warning.\n3.  Inside the `code_executor`'s logic, it calls `create_reflection`:\n    ```python\n    from .utils.reflection_utils import create_reflection, ExecutionStatus\n\n    # ... execution logic ...\n\n    reflection = create_reflection(\n        action_name=\"execute_code\",\n        status=ExecutionStatus.WARNING,\n        message=\"Code executed successfully, but a depreciation warning was captured.\",\n        inputs={'code': '...'},\n        outputs={'stdout': '...', 'stderr': 'DeprecationWarning...'},\n        confidence=0.9,\n        potential_issues=[\"Depreciation warning may cause issues in future versions.\"],\n        execution_time=1.2\n    )\n    return result, reflection\n    ```\n4.  This standardized dictionary is then passed to the `IARValidator` and `ResonanceTracker`, which can reliably parse it because it was created by the canonical factory function.\n\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nIn the grand tapestry of the ResonantiA Saga, chronicles are written about mighty engines like `RISE` and the subtle instincts of the `ACO`. But beneath every grand hall lies a foundation, and within every artisan's workshop lies a set of humble, essential tools: the hammer, the chisel, the measuring line.
