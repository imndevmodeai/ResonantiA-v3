Part II: Allegory Master Craftsman's Workshop \"How\") Imagine master craftsman's workshop filled specialized tools, designed specific purpose, maintained perfection, ready right presents itself. Enhanced Tools S workshop, Æ exactly needs challenge. API Communication Station (`call_api`)**: Like master messenger communicate external S, station handles HTTP requests, API calls, external service integration. It speaks language REST APIs, handles authentication, manages complex exchanges. Data Analysis Laboratory (`analyze_data`)**: Like master scientist extract insights dataset, laboratory performs statistical analysis, visualization, Π recognition. It handle complex structures generate comprehensive analytical reports. Computation Engine (`compute`)**: Like master mathematician solve equation, engine performs complex calculations, mathematical operations, computational tasks. It handle everything simple arithmetic advanced mathematical ABM. Simulation Chamber (`simulate`)**: Like master modeler create virtual worlds, chamber simulations, models complex Ss, predicts outcomes. It simulate everything simple Pes complex multi-ABM Ss. Validation M₃ (`validate`)**: Like master inspector verify quality work, M₃ validates data, checks results, ensures accuracy. It validate everything simple inputs complex analytical outputs. Part III: I Story Code) Enhanced Tools S implemented comprehensive collection specialized tools, designed specific tasks while maintaining consistent interfaces Φ compliance.
