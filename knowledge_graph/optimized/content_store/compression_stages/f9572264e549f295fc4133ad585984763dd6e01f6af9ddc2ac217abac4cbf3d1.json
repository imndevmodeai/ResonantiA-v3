Data cleaning procedures are essential to address these issues, ensuring the data is consistent and usable for further analysis.\nTransforming Data into a Usable Format: Raw data often requires transformation before it can be effectively analyzed or used for training machine learning models. This might involve converting data types, restructuring data into a tabular format, or applying mathematical operations.\nAggregating Data for Insights: Data aggregation combines data from multiple sources or different parts of a dataset to extract meaningful insights. This could involve calculating summary statistics like averages, counts, or creating new variables based on existing data.\nConsider a scenario where you're extracting product information from an e-commerce website using AgentQL\n\nSPR MENTION CONTEXT (model):\ng missing values in product descriptions, and standardizing the format of reviews.\nTransformation: Converting prices to a uniform currency, extracting numerical ratings from text reviews, and categorizing products based on their descriptions.\nAggregation: Calculating average product ratings, grouping products by category, and identifying the best-selling products based on sales data.\nThese processing steps prepare the data for further analysis, enabling tasks like:\n\n\nTraining a machine learning model to predict future product sales based on historical data.\nBuilding a recommendation system that suggests products to users based on their preferences.\nAnalyzing customer sentiment towards different product categories.\nIn conclusion, data processing is an integral part of data extraction, bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights.
