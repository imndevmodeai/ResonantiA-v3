When blocked tributaries (temporal reasoning, vetting, insight solidification) are released, they cause phase-transition-level entanglement, potentially pushing collective intelligence from Phase 3 toward Phase 4.\n\nBLUEPRINT DETAILS:\nCFP Framework concept from Quantum River chronicle. Part of Comparative Fluxual Processing architecture.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nApply CFP to analyze Emergence in ArchE's operational-cognitive balance.\n\nCATEGORY: CorePrinciple\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\ntype: CFP Framework; source: cfp_chronicle; source_type: cfp_chronicle; related_to: ComparativE fluxuaL processinG, QuantumfluxsimulatoR, ActioncontexT, ActioncontextcognitivE",
