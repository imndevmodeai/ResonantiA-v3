# ArchE Implementation Plan - 8 Missing Code Files

## Executive Summary
Based on comprehensive analysis of @Happier project, I've identified existing implementations requiring PhD-level enhancements and missing implementations needing creation.

## Implementation Status Analysis

### ✅ EXISTING IMPLEMENTATIONS (Need Enhancement):
1. **vetting_agent.py** - Found in Three_Point5_ArchE/ (247 lines)
2. **visual_cognitive_debugger_ui.py** - Found in Three_Point5_ArchE/ (249 lines)  
3. **websocket_bridge.py** - Found in Three_Point5_ArchE/ (192 lines)
4. **executable_spec_parser.py** - Found in both versions (240/217 lines)

### ❌ MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS (Need Creation):
5. **cfp_evolution.py** - Comparative Fluxual Processing evolution
6. **system_version_v4.py** - System version management
7. **autopoietic_genesis_protocol.py** - Self-creation protocol
8. **directory_organization.py** - Directory structure management

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhance Existing (Priority 1)
- Integrate with CRITICAL_MANDATES.md compliance
- Add PhD-level cognitive enhancements
- Ensure DRCL compliance
- Implement IAR-compliant responses

### Phase 2: Create Missing (Priority 2)  
- Build from specifications with full ArchE integration
- Implement advanced cognitive capabilities
- Ensure seamless workflow integration

### Phase 3: Validation (Priority 3)
- Validate against all CRITICAL_MANDATES.md
- Ensure DRCL compliance
- Test integration with workflow engine

## Next Steps
Proceeding with enhanced vetting_agent.py implementation first, incorporating all CRITICAL_MANDATES.md requirements and PhD-level cognitive enhancements.
