## 📋 PHASE 3: Workflows (6 workflows)

All workflows are JSON-based and operationalize the capabilities created in Phase 1:
1. cognitive_resonance_assessment.json
2. iar_validation.json
3. temporal_analysis.json
4. anomaly_detection.json
5. health_monitoring.json
6. 4d_thinking_workflow.json

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Test Phase 1 implementations**:
   - Verify iar_anomaly_detector.py works with actual IAR streams
   - Test system_health_monitor.py integration
   - Validate integration with existing systems

2. **Continue with Phase 2**:
   - Start with vcd_backup_recovery.py (highest priority)
   - Then vcd_configuration_management.py
   - Follow with remaining VCD components

3. **Create Workflows** (Phase 3):
   - Once Phase 2 is complete, create workflows to operationalize capabilities

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each new component
- Integration tests with existing systems
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Performance testing under load
