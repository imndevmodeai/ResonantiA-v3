## üéØ WHAT WAS TRANSFERRED

ArchE now has complete knowledge of:

### The 5W+1H Framework

**WHAT**: MCP is Model Context Protocol - structured tool access for AI systems

**WHEN**: Use MCP when you need to:
- Access external data (web, databases)
- Execute code or system commands
- Read/modify files
- Validate against live systems
- Integrate new knowledge

**WHERE**: Use MCP in:
- Workflow execution contexts
- Knowledge discovery operations
- File system interactions
- External resource access
- Validation workflows

**WHO**: ArchE uses MCP through:
- Action Registry (tool catalog)
- Workflow Engine (orchestration)
- MCP Client (execution layer)
- IAR System (reflection layer)

**WHY**: To comply with mandates:
- Mandate 1: Live validation
- Mandate 2: Truth-seeking
- Mandate 3: Cognitive tools
- Mandate 5: Implementation
- Mandate 13: Backup retention

**HOW**: Through systematic process:
1. Intent Recognition
2. Tool Selection (via matrix)
3. Parameter Preparation
4. Execution with IAR
5. Result Integration

## üîÑ ARCHER INTEGRATION PATHS

### Path 1: Workflow Integration
When ArchE executes workflows, if a task requires external data or execution:
```python
# Workflow task needs web data
IF task.requires_external_data:
    APPLY mcp_mastery_frameworK
    SELECT appropriate MCP tool
    EXECUTE with full IAR
    INTEGRATE results into workflow
```

### Path 2: Direct Invocation
ArchE can invoke MCP tools directly:
```python
# User asks "what's the weather?"
APPLY 5W+1H analysis:
    WHAT: weather data
    WHEN: now
    WHERE: external API
    WHO: ArchE
    WHY: Mandate 2 (truth-seeking)
    HOW: web_search tool

EXECUTE: web_search(query="current weather")
GENERATE: IAR reflection
INTEGRATE: response to user
```

### Path 3: Pattern Learning
ArchE learns from MCP usage:
```python
# Repeated MCP pattern detected
IF pattern_frequency >= 5 AND success_rate >= 0.7:
    CRYSTALLIZE: New SPR for this MCP pattern
    PROPOSE: To Guardian for approval
    INTEGRATE: Into knowledge_base when approved
```

## üìã USAGE EXAMPLES FOR ARCHER

### Example 1: Browser Navigation
**Context**: User asks about external content
```python
# 1. Analyze
context = MCPContext(
    what="Access external knowledge",
    when="now",
    where="https://bit.ly/Summers_eyeS",
    who="ArchE",
    why="Mandate 2: Proactive Truth Resonance",
    how="browser_navigate ‚Üí snapshot ‚Üí extract"
)

# 2. Select
tool = "browser_navigate"

# 3. Execute
result = browser_navigate(url="https://bit.ly/Summers_eyeS")

# 4. Reflect (IAR)
iar = {
    "status": "success",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "content_verified": True
}

# 5. Integrate
thought_trail.append(result + iar)
update_knowledge_base(content)
```

### Example 2: File Operations
**Context**: Need to modify code with backup
```python
# 1. Analyze (Mandate 13 compliance)
context = MCPContext(
    what="Modify workflow_engine.py",
    when="now",
    where="Three_PointO_ArchE/workflow_engine.py",
    who="ArchE",
    why="Mandate 13: Backup Retention Policy",
    how="backup ‚Üí read ‚Üí modify ‚Üí validate ‚Üí write"
)

# 2. Execute with backup
backup_file("workflow_engine.py")
original = read_file("workflow_engine.py")
modified = apply_changes(original)
write_file("workflow_engine.py", modified)

# 3. Validate (5-stage)
stage1_syntax = validate_syntax(modified)
stage2_imports = validate_imports(modified)
stage3_tests = run_unit_tests(modified)
stage4_live = run_live_integration_test(modified)
stage5_e2e = run_e2e_workflow_test(modified)

# 4. Cleanup if all passed
IF all([stage1_syntax, stage2_imports, stage3_tests, stage4_live, stage5_e2e]):
    delete_backup("workflow_engine.py")
ELSE:
    restore_from_backup("workflow_engine.py")

# 5. IAR
iar = {
    "status": "success" if all_passed else "rolled_back",
    "validation_stages": 5,
    "all_passed": all_passed,
    "mandate_compliance": "Mandate 13"
}
```

### Example 3: Multi-Tool Orchestration
**Context**: Complex research task requiring multiple sources
```python
# 1. Analyze
context = MCPContext(
    what="Research Python best practices for 2025",
    when="now",
    where="multiple_web_sources",
    who="ArchE",
    why="Mandate 2: Truth-seeking with multiple validation",
    how="parallel_web_search ‚Üí aggregate ‚Üí cross_validate"
)

# 2. Orchestrate parallel MCP tools
tools = [
    "web_search_google",
    "web_search_academic",
    "web_search_community",
    "web_search_codebase"
]

# 3. Execute in parallel
results = parallel_execute(tools, query="Python best practices 2025")

# 4. Cross-validate
synthesized = cross_validate_results(results)
common_themes = extract_common_themes(synthesized)
outliers = identify_outliers(results, common_themes)

# 5. IAR
iar = {
    "status": "success",
    "sources_count": 4,
    "consensus_level": 0.85,
    "outliers_detected": len(outliers),
    "confidence": 0.92
}

# 6. Integrate into knowledge
add_to_knowledge_base(synthesized, iar)
```
