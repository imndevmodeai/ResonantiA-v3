# ResonantiA Protocol v3.0 (Placeholder for Local Test)

This is a test version of the ResonantiA Protocol v3.0.

Its purpose is to verify that the `arche_snapshot.py` script can correctly read this file and include its content in the generated snapshots.

If you see this text in a snapshot's protocol file, the local file-reading mechanism is working.
