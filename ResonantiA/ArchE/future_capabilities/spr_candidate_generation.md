# Blueprint: SPR Candidate Generator

**SPR ID:** `SPRCandidateGeneratoR`
**Status:** Conceptual
**Maturity Level:** Exploratory

This document outlines the conceptual framework, existing foundational components, and future development areas for the **SPR Candidate Generator**. This system is envisioned to analyze Keyholder queries, LLM outputs, Integrated Action Reflection (IAR) summaries, and other information sources to identify and suggest new candidate Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs) for the Knowledge Tapestry (KnO), thereby aiding its growth and refinement.

## 1. Core Concept & Purpose

The `SPRCandidateGeneratoR` aims to accelerate the evolution and comprehensiveness of the Knowledge Tapestry by empowering ArchE to proactively contribute to its own knowledge base. Its core functions include:

*   **Analyzing diverse information sources:** Including Keyholder interaction logs, LLM outputs, IAR summaries, and potentially broader corpus data.
*   **Identifying knowledge gaps:** Pinpointing frequently occurring concepts, terms, or phrases that lack corresponding SPRs or whose existing SPRs might be inadequate.
*   **Recognizing salient patterns:** Identifying terms or concepts that consistently correlate with successful (high confidence IAR) or problematic (low confidence/failed IAR) outcomes.
*   **Drafting candidate SPRs:** Utilizing an LLM to generate initial definitions, terms, categories, and relationship suggestions for new or refined SPRs.
*   **Facilitating Keyholder review:** Presenting these candidates to the Keyholder for validation and potential submission to the `InsightSolidificatioN` workflow.

## 2. Relationship with KnO Refinement and Insight Solidification

This capability is intrinsically linked to:
*   **`KnORefinementEnginE`:** While the `SPRCandidateGeneratoR` focuses on proposing *new* entities, the `KnORefinementEnginE` (also conceptual) would focus on the broader quality, consistency, and completeness of the existing KnO.
*   **`InsightSolidificatioN` Workflow:** This existing workflow (defined in `ResonantiA/workflows/insight_solidification.json`) is the designated pathway for formalizing vetted insights, including new SPRs, into the Knowledge Tapestry.

## 3. Existing Foundational Components

The ResonantiA ArchE codebase currently includes components that provide foundational support for the `SPRCandidateGeneratoR`:

*   **`spr_manager.py`:** This module is central to managing SPRs. It provides:
    *   Core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for SPR definitions.
    *   Methods like `add_spr` and `conceptual_write_spr` which would be used by the generator to store new candidates (even if initially in a pending state).
    *   Validation mechanisms for SPR structure.
*   **`llm_providers.py`:** This module offers a standardized interface to various Large Language Models (LLMs). The `invoke_llm` tool, powered by this module, can be leveraged by the `SPRCandidateGeneratoR` to:
    *   Draft definitions for newly identified terms.
    *   Suggest potential relationships based on contextual understanding.
    *   Format candidate SPRs.
*   **`ResonantiA/workflows/insight_solidification.json`:** The existence of this workflow file confirms a defined process for incorporating new, validated SPRs into the KnO. The `SPRCandidateGeneratoR` would feed its vetted suggestions into this process.

## 4. Identified Gaps and Future Development

Despite the foundational support, the `SPRCandidateGeneratoR` as an autonomous system requires significant development:

*   **Intelligent Analysis Engine:**
    *   Algorithms and techniques for processing and analyzing diverse data sources (Keyholder logs, LLM outputs, IARs) to identify recurring, undefined, or impactful concepts.
    *   This might involve NLP techniques, pattern mining, or ML models trained to recognize potential SPR candidates.
*   **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:**
    *   Mechanisms to collect, store, and prepare the various input data streams for analysis.
*   **Candidate Prioritization and Filtering:**
    *   Logic to rank or filter suggested SPR candidates based on relevance, potential impact, or confidence scores before presenting them to the Keyholder.
*   **Keyholder Interaction Interface:**
    *   A user interface or structured interaction method for the Keyholder to review, edit, approve, or reject candidate SPRs.
*   **Workflow Orchestration:**
    *   A dedicated workflow that orchestrates the steps of data analysis, candidate generation, LLM-based drafting, and presentation to the Keyholder.
*   **Integration with `KnORefinementEnginE`:**
    *   Defining the interaction points if both conceptual systems are developed, e.g., ensuring candidates are checked against existing refinement suggestions.

## 5. Conclusion

The `SPRCandidateGeneratoR` represents a significant step towards a self-evolving Knowledge Tapestry in ArchE. While core components for SPR management (`spr_manager.py`), LLM interaction (`llm_providers.py`), and insight formalization (`insight_solidification.json`) are in place, the development of the intelligent analysis engine and the full workflow for autonomous candidate generation remains a key area for future work. This capability is crucial for enhancing the depth, breadth, and operational relevance of ArchE's internal knowledge.
