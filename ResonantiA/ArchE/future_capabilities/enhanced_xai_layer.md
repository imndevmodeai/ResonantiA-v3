# Placeholder: Enhanced XAI Layer\n\nThis document will describe the conceptual framework and potential implementation details for the **Enhanced Explainable AI (XAI) Layer**, including the `ExplainableReasoningEnginE`.\n\n**Core Concept:** Provide deeper, more intuitive human-understandable explanations for Arche's decisions, outputs, and internal states by integrating IAR data, SPR links, and detailed causal/temporal traces from workflow executions.\n\n**Key Features (Conceptual):**\n- Generation of narrative explanations.\n- Visualization of decision pathways and data flow.\n- Integration of `TemporalCausalTracE` data.\n- Linkage to relevant SPRs for conceptual grounding.\n
