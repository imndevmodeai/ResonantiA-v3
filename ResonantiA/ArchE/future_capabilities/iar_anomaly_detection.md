# Placeholder: IAR Anomaly Detection\n\nThis document will describe the conceptual framework and potential implementation details for the **IAR Anomaly Detector** system component or workflow.\n\n**Core Concept:** Continuously analyze IAR data streams to detect significant deviations, anomalies, or degradations in system performance or output quality, learning baseline patterns and flagging potential issues.\n\n**Key Features (Conceptual):**\n- Learning of baseline IAR patterns.\n- Detection of deviations (e.g., confidence drops, new error types).\n- Alerting mechanisms.\n- Potential integration with `PredictivEModelinGTooL`.\n
