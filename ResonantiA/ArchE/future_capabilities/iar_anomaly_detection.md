# Blueprint: IAR Anomaly Detection

**SPR ID:** `IARAnomalyDetectoR`
**Status:** Conceptual
**Maturity Level:** Exploratory

This document outlines the conceptual framework, existing foundational components, and future development areas for the **IAR Anomaly Detector** system. This system is envisioned as a component or workflow that continuously analyzes Integrated Action Reflection (IAR) data streams to detect significant deviations, anomalies, or degradations in system performance or output quality. It aims to learn baseline patterns and flag potential issues proactively.

## 1. Core Concept & Purpose

The primary goal of the `IARAnomalyDetectoR` is to enhance system resilience and reliability by moving from purely reactive error handling to proactive system health management and early warning. It achieves this by:

*   Learning baseline IAR patterns (e.g., typical confidence ranges for specific tools/tasks, common non-critical `potential_issues`).
*   Detecting significant deviations or anomalies from these baselines.
*   Flagging issues such as:
    *   Sudden drops in confidence for usually reliable tools.
    *   Unexpected new types of `potential_issues` appearing frequently.
    *   Tasks consistently failing or taking longer than historical averages.
*   Potentially triggering alerts to the Keyholder or initiating automated diagnostic workflows (a specialized `Metacognitive shifT`).

## 2. Relationship with Predictive System Health

This capability is closely related to the `PredictiveSystemHealtH` SPR, which aims to use historical IAR data and other metrics to predict future system health issues. The `IARAnomalyDetectoR` can be seen as a component that feeds into or works alongside such a predictive system.

## 3. Existing Foundational Components

The ResonantiA ArchE codebase currently includes foundational components that support the development of the `IARAnomalyDetectoR`:

*   **`predictive_modeling_tool.py` (`PredictivEModelinGTooL` SPR):** This module provides crucial capabilities for:
    *   Training time-series models (e.g., ARIMA).
    *   Forecasting future states based on trained models.
    *   Preparing time-indexed data, suitable for analyzing IAR streams.
    *   Its `run_prediction(operation='forecast_future_states', ...)` function can be leveraged to predict future IAR metrics or system health indicators, which is a step towards anomaly detection (e.g., by analyzing residuals or forecast errors).

## 4. Identified Gaps and Future Development

While `predictive_modeling_tool.py` provides a strong foundation, the full realization of the `IARAnomalyDetectoR` requires further development:

*   **Dedicated Anomaly Detection Algorithms:**
    *   Integration of specific statistical process control methods.
    *   Implementation or integration of dedicated time-series anomaly detection algorithms beyond standard forecasting model residuals (e.g., One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest adapted for time series, LOF, clustering-based methods).
*   **IAR Stream Processing & Baseline Learning:**
    *   A robust mechanism for continuously ingesting and processing streams of IAR data from various workflow executions.
    *   Algorithms for dynamically learning and updating baseline IAR patterns for different tasks, tools, and contexts.
*   **Orchestration and Workflow:**
    *   Development of a persistent background process or a scheduled workflow specifically designed for `IAR` anomaly detection.
    *   This orchestration layer would utilize `predictive_modeling_tool.py` and other specialized anomaly detection components.
*   **Alerting and Response System:**
    *   A system for generating meaningful alerts for the Keyholder upon detection of critical anomalies.
    *   Mechanisms to trigger automated diagnostic workflows or a `Metacognitive shifT` based on the nature and severity of detected anomalies.
*   **Integration with `PredictiveSystemHealtH`:**
    *   Clear definition of data flow and interaction points if this is developed as a distinct but related capability.

## 5. Conclusion

The `IARAnomalyDetectoR` is a key conceptual component for enhancing ArchE's self-awareness and proactive maintenance. The existing `predictive_modeling_tool.py` offers a solid starting point for the analytical engine. Future work will focus on developing the specialized anomaly detection techniques, data streaming infrastructure, and the overarching orchestration workflow to bring this capability to fruition.
