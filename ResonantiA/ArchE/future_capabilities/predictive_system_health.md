# Placeholder: Predictive System Health\n\nThis document will describe the conceptual framework and potential implementation details for the **Predictive System Health Monitor**.\n\n**Core Concept:** Use historical IAR data and other operational metrics to predict potential future system health issues (e.g., API failures, resource exhaustion, model drift) before they become critical, enabling pre-emptive action.\n\n**Key Features (Conceptual):**\n- Analysis of historical IAR data and system metrics.\n- Predictive modeling of potential system failures or degradations.\n- Generation of health forecasts and risk alerts.\n- Linkage with `IARAnomalyDetectoR`.\n
