# Placeholder: Dynamic Process Adaptation\n\nThis document will describe the conceptual framework and potential implementation details for **Dynamic Process Adaptation**.\n\n**Core Concept:** The capability of Arche to dynamically adjust its Process Blueprints or their execution based on real-time context, IAR feedback, or suggestions from a Workflow Optimizer Agent. Involves more flexible workflow representations.\n\n**Key Features (Conceptual):**\n- Flexible workflow representations allowing for dynamic changes.\n- Real-time context analysis to inform adaptation.\n- Mechanisms for adjusting tool choices, parameters, or workflow paths during execution.\n- Integration with `WorkflowOptimizerAgenT`.\n
