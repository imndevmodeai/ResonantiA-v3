# Placeholder: Knowledge Tapestry Refinement Engine\n\nThis document will describe the conceptual framework and potential implementation details for the **Knowledge Tapestry Refinement Engine (KnO Refinement EnginE)**.\n\n**Core Concept:** Assist in maintaining and improving the quality, consistency, and completeness of the Knowledge Tapestry (SPR definitions). It might identify underused SPRs, conflicting definitions, or areas needing more semantic depth.\n\n**Key Features (Conceptual):**\n- Analysis of SPR definitions and usage patterns.\n- Identification of inconsistencies, overlaps, or gaps in the Knowledge Tapestry.\n- Generation of refinement suggestions.\n- Support for knowledge integrity and continuous improvement.\n
