# Placeholder: Workflow Self-Optimization\n\nThis document will describe the conceptual framework and potential implementation details for **Dynamic Workflow Self-Optimization via Meta-Learning**, including the `WorkflowOptimizerAgenT`.\n\n**Core Concept:** Enable Arche to learn from aggregated IAR data and workflow success/failure metrics to autonomously propose optimizations or alternative structures for its own Process Blueprints over time.\n\n**Key Features (Conceptual):**\n- Representation of workflows for modification.\n- Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for exploring workflow variations.\n- Reward mechanisms based on IAR, efficiency, and goal alignment.\n- Vetting process for proposed optimizations.\n
