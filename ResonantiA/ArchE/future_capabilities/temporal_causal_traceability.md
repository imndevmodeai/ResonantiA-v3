# Placeholder: Temporal Causal Traceability\n\nThis document will describe the conceptual framework and potential implementation details for **Temporal Causal Traceability** and the `TemporalCausalTracE` data structure.\n\n**Core Concept:** Create a structured, timestamped record of workflow executions, capturing the sequence of operations, data transformations, identified causal links (via tools like `CausalInferenceTooL`), and IAR snapshots at each step. This trace serves as a foundational element for advanced XAI and debugging.\n\n**Key Features (Conceptual):**\n- Detailed logging of workflow execution paths.\n- Capturing of data lineage through transformations.\n- Recording of identified causal relationships and their temporal context.\n- Storing IAR data associated with each step.\n- Standardized format for `TemporalCausalTracE` objects.\n
