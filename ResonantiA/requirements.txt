# Core Python utilities often used in analysis and tools
numpy             # Fundamental package for numerical computing
scipy             # Scientific computing library (stats, optimization, linear algebra)
pandas            # Data manipulation and analysis (DataFrames)
requests          # For making HTTP requests (used by ApiTool, SearchTool concepts)
networkx          # For graph manipulation (potentially used in Causal Discovery, KnO visualization)

# LLM Provider Libraries (install specific ones needed based on config.py)
openai>=1.0       # For OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) - Ensure v1+
google-generativeai # For Google models (Gemini)
# anthropic       # Uncomment if using Anthropic models (Claude)
# cohere          # Uncomment if using Cohere models

# Code Executor Sandboxing (Docker Recommended for Security)
docker            # Python library for interacting with the Docker daemon API

# Agent-Based Modeling Tool (Section 3.13, 7.14)
mesa              # Core library for agent-based modeling framework
matplotlib        # For generating visualizations of ABM results

# Causal Inference Tool (Temporal Capabilities - Section 3.12, 7.13)
dowhy             # Core framework for causal estimation (requires graphviz potentially)
# statsmodels is already listed above
# causal-learn    # Optional: Library for various causal discovery algorithms (PC, GES, etc.)
# gcastle         # Optional: Another library with causal discovery algorithms
# tigramite       # Optional: For advanced temporal causal discovery (PCMCI+) - Requires careful setup

# Optional: Enhanced data handling or tool features
# pyarrow         # For efficient data serialization (e.g., Feather format with pandas)
# sqlalchemy      # For interacting with SQL databases beyond basic simulation
